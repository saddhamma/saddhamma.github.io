“The world should sieze its opportunity, the world should sieze its
opportunity,” O bhikkhus, [so] speaks the Dhamma-deaf
puthujjana. But he does not know what is an opportune time or inopportune
time. There are these eight inopportune times, O bhikkhus, not the occasion
for the living of the life of purity. Which eight?

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“Here, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata has arisen in the world, the Arahant,
the rightly self-awakened one, excelling in knowledge and conduct,
well-farer, knower of worlds, incomparable trainer of persons to be tamed,
teacher of devas and humans, awakened, auspicious, and the Dhamma as
declared by the Well-farer is being taught, leading to cessation, leading to
total extinction, leading to self-awakening. But this individual has arisen
in hell. This, O bhikkhus, is the first inopportune time, not the occasion
for the living of the life of purity.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata has arisen in the world, the Arahant,
the rightly self-awakened one, excelling in knowledge and conduct,
well-farer, knower of worlds, incomparable trainer of persons to be tamed,
teacher of devas and humans, awakened, auspicious, and the Dhamma as
declared by the Well-farer is being taught, leading to cessation, leading to
total extinction, leading to self-awakening. But this individual has arisen
in the animal womb. This, O bhikkhus, is the second inopportune time, not
the occasion for the living of the life of purity.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata has arisen in the world, the Arahant,
the rightly self-awakened one, excelling in knowledge and conduct,
well-farer, knower of worlds, incomparable trainer of persons to be tamed,
teacher of devas and humans, awakened, auspicious, and the Dhamma as
declared by the Well-farer is being taught, leading to cessation, leading to
total extinction, leading to self-awakening. But this individual has arisen
in the sphere of ghost. This, O bhikkhus, is the third inopportune time, not
the occasion for the living of the life of purity.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata has arisen in the world, the Arahant,
the rightly self-awakened one, excelling in knowledge and conduct,
well-farer, knower of worlds, incomparable trainer of persons to be tamed,
teacher of devas and humans, awakened, auspicious, and the Dhamma as
declared by the Well-farer is being taught, leading to cessation, leading to
total extinction, leading to self-awakening. But this individual has arisen
among a certain long lived deva group. This, O bhikkhus, is the fourth
inopportune time, not the occasion for the living of the life of purity.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata has arisen in the world, the Arahant,
the rightly self-awakened one, excelling in knowledge and conduct,
well-farer, knower of worlds, incomparable trainer of persons to be tamed,
teacher of devas and humans, awakened, auspicious, and the Dhamma as
declared by the Well-farer is being taught, leading to cessation, leading to
total extinction, leading to self-awakening. But this individual has taken
birth in a country situated far away, among uncivilized barbarians, where
bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, male lay disciples and female lay disciples do not
go. This, O bhikkhus, is the fifth inopportune time, not the occasion for
the living of the life of purity.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata has arisen in the world, the Arahant,
the rightly self-awakened one, excelling in knowledge and conduct,
well-farer, knower of worlds, incomparable trainer of persons to be tamed,
teacher of devas and humans, awakened, auspicious, and the Dhamma as
declared by the Well-farer is being taught, leading to cessation, leading to
total extinction, leading to self-awakening. But although this individual
has taken birth in the middle country, he holds wrong view and a distorted
perspective: “There is not what is offered, there is not what is given,
there is not what is sacrificed. There are no fruits and results of kamma,
of what is well done and badly done. There is not this world, there is not
another world, there is not mother, there is not father, there are no beings
from spontaneous birth, there is not in the world samanas and brahmanas who
have come to the right path, entered upon the right path, those who, having
realized by themselves this world and the other world with higher knowledge,
they cause to make it known.” This, O bhikkhus, is the sixth
inopportune time, not the occasion for the living of the life of purity.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata has arisen in the world, the Arahant,
the rightly self-awakened one, excelling in knowledge and conduct,
well-farer, knower of worlds, incomparable trainer of persons to be tamed,
teacher of devas and humans, awakened, auspicious, and the Dhamma as
declared by the Well-farer is being taught, leading to cessation, leading to
total extinction, leading to self-awakening. But although this individual
has taken birth in the middle country, he is unwise, stupid, dull-witted,
not able to understand the meaning of what is well-spoken and what is
badly-spoken. This, O bhikkhus, is the seventh inopportune time, not the
occasion for the living of the life of purity.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata has arisen in the world, the Arahant,
the rightly self-awakened one, excelling in knowledge and conduct,

declared by the Well-farer is not being taught, leading to cessation,
leading to total extinction, leading to self-awakening. Yet this individual
has taken birth in the middle country, he is wise, not stupid, not
dull-witted, able to understand the meaning of what is well-spoken and what
is badly-spoken. This, O bhikkhus, is the eighth inopportune time, not the

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
There is just one unique opportune time, O bhikkhus, an occasion for the
living of the life of purity. Which one? Here, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata has
arisen in the world, the Arahant, the rightly self-awakened one, excelling
in knowledge and conduct, well-farer, knower of worlds, incomparable trainer
of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, awakened, auspicious,
and the Dhamma as declared by the Well-farer is being taught, leading to
cessation, leading to total extinction, leading to self-awakening. And this
individual has taken birth in the middle country, he is wise, not stupid,
not dull-witted, able to understand the meaning of what is well-spoken and
what is badly-spoken. This, O bhikkhus, is just the one unique opportune
time, an occasion for the living of the life of purity.”
