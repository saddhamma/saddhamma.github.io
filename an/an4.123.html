<p><span class="parno">1</span>
These four individuals, O bhikkhus, are to be found existing in the
world. Which three?

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, quite secluded from sense-desires, secluded from
unwholesome dhammas, a certain individual enters upon and abides in the
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion connected with thinking and
pondering, the first jhana. He enjoys that, strives after that, and enters
upon happiness by that. Settled therein, resolved on that, a frequent
dweller in that, not fallen away from it when passing away, he rises in
companionship with the devas of Brahma's company. For the devas of Brahma's
company, O bhikkhus, their lifespan is one aeon. The puthujjana, having
remained there as long as life lasts, having spent as much as all that deva
lifespan, even goes to hell, even goes to the animal womb, even goes to the
sphere of ghost. But for the Auspicious One's disciple, having remained
there as long as life last, having spent as much as all that deva lifespan,
simply attains nibbana at that place. This, O bhikkhus, is the distinction,
this is the disparity, this is the difference between the Dhamma-hearer, the
noble disciple, and the Dhamma-deaf puthujjana, that is when there is future
destination, reappearance.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, from the subsiding of thinking and pondering, with
the internal tranquilization and unification of mind [due to] the absence of
thinking and pondering, a certain individual here enters upon and abides in
the rapture and pleasure born of samadhi, the second jhana. He enjoys that,
strives after that, and enters upon happiness by that. Settled therein,
resolved on that, a frequent dweller in that, not fallen away from it when
passing away, he rises in companionship with the abhassara devas. For the
abhassara devas, O bhikkhus, their lifespan is two aeons. The puthujjana,
having remained there as long as life lasts, having spent as much as all
that deva lifespan, even goes to hell, even goes to the animal womb, even
goes to the sphere of ghost. But for the Auspicious One's disciple, having
remained there as long as life last, having spent as much as all that deva
lifespan, simply attains nibbana at that place. This, O bhikkhus, is the
distinction, this is the disparity, this is the difference between the
Dhamma-hearer, the noble disciple, and the Dhamma-deaf puthujjana, that is
when there is future destination, reappearance.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, with the fading away of rapture, a certain
individual here dwelling mindful and clearly comprehending, looks on with
equanimity as he experiences pleasure in the body, of which the Noble Ones
say: “He is a mindful one who [looks on with] equanimity, one who dwells
in pleasure.” He enters upon and abides in the third jhana. He
enjoys that, strives after that, and enters upon happiness by that. Settled
therein, resolved on that, a frequent dweller in that, not fallen away from
it when passing away, he rises in companionship with the subhakinha
devas. For the subhakinha devas, O bhikkhus, their lifespan is four
aeons. The puthujjana, having remained there as long as life lasts, having
spent as much as all that deva lifespan, even goes to hell, even goes to the
animal womb, even goes to the sphere of ghost. But for the Auspicious One's
disciple, having remained there as long as life last, having spent as much
as all that deva lifespan, simply attains nibbana at that place. This, O
bhikkhus, is the distinction, this is the disparity, this is the difference
between the Dhamma-hearer, the noble disciple, and the Dhamma-deaf
puthujjana, that is when there is future destination, reappearance.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, from the abandoning of [physical] pleasure and
pain, from the extinction of former mental pleasure and mental pain, a
certain individual here enters upon and abides in the utter purity of
mindfulness and equanimity without pain and pleasure, the fourth jhana. He
enters upon and abides in the third jhana. He enjoys that, strives after
that, and enters upon happiness by that. Settled therein, resolved on that,
a frequent dweller in that, not fallen away from it when passing away, he
rises in companionship with the vehapphala devas. For the vehapphala devas,
O bhikkhus, their lifespan is five hundred aeons. The puthujjana, having
remained there as long as life lasts, having spent as much as all that deva
lifespan, even goes to hell, even goes to the animal womb, even goes to the
sphere of ghost. But for the Auspicious One's disciple, having remained
there as long as life last, having spent as much as all that deva lifespan,
simply attains nibbana at that place. This, O bhikkhus, is the distinction,
this is the disparity, this is the difference between the Dhamma-hearer, the
noble disciple, and the Dhamma-deaf puthujjana, that is when there is future
destination, reappearance.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
These, O bhikkhus, are the four individuals to be found existing in the
world.
