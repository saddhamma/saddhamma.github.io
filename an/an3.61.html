These three standpoints, O bhikkhus, when being cross-questioned, being
cross-examined, being scrutinized to its conclusion by the wise, is
established on non-doing. What three? There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas
and brahmanas who hold such doctrine, such view: “Whatever this
individual person experiences, whether pleasure, pain or neither pain nor
pleasure, all that is caused by what was done in the past.” There
are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas who hold such doctrine, such
view: “Whatever this individual person experiences, whether pleasure,
pain or neither pain nor pleasure, all that is caused by God's
creation.” There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas who
hold such doctrine, such view: “Whatever this individual person
experiences, whether pleasure, pain or neither pain nor pleasure, all that
is conditioned without a cause.”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those samanas and brahmanas who hold such doctrine,
such view: “Whatever this individual person experiences, whether
pleasure, pain or neither pain nor pleasure, all that is caused by what was
done in the past,” having approached them, I say thus: “Is it
true as reported, O venerables, that you hold such doctrine, such view:
“Whatever this individual person experiences, whether pleasure, pain or
neither pain nor pleasure, all that is caused by what was done in the
past”? Being asked by me thus, if they acknowledge
“yes”, I say to them thus: if that is so, O venerables, the
killing of living beings will be caused by what was done in the past, the
taking of what is not given will be caused by what was done in the past,
non-celibacy will be caused by what was done in the past, [uttering of]
false speech will be caused by what was done in the past, [uttering of]
divisive speech will be caused by what was done in the past, [uttering of]
harsh speech will be caused by what was done in the past, [uttering of]
senseless prattle will be caused by what was done in the past, being
covetous will be caused by what was done in the past, harboring the mind of
ill-will will be caused by what was done in the past.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
For those, O bhikkhus, who rely on what was done in the past as the essence,
there is not the desire or effort: this ought to be done, this ought not to
be done. Since what ought to be done and what ought not to be done is not
being found [by them] as real and actual, their mindfulness is muddled, they
dwell unguarded, and the designation as samana by their Dhamma companions
does not personally apply to them. This, O bhikkhus, is my first reproach as
a Dhamma companion among those samanas and brahmanas who hold such doctrine,
such view.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>

Dhamma companion among those samanas and brahmanas who hold such doctrine,
such view.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those samanas and brahmanas who hold such doctrine,
such view: “Whatever this individual person experiences, whether
pleasure, pain or neither pain nor pleasure, all that is conditioned without
a cause,” having approached them, I say thus: “Is it true as

without a cause, the taking of what is not given will be conditioned without

false speech will be conditioned without a cause, [uttering of] divisive
speech will be conditioned without a cause, [uttering of] harsh speech will
be conditioned without a cause, [uttering of] senseless prattle will be
conditioned without a cause, being covetous will be conditioned without a
cause, harboring the mind of ill-will will be conditioned without a cause.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
For those, O bhikkhus, who rely on non-causality as the essence, there is
not the desire or effort: this ought to be done, this ought not to be
done. Since what ought to be done and what ought not to be done is not being
found [by them] as real and actual, their mindfulness is muddled, they dwell
unguarded, and the designation as samana by their Dhamma companions does not
personally apply to them. This, O bhikkhus, is my third reproach as a Dhamma
companion among those samanas and brahmanas who hold such doctrine, such
view.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
These, O bhikkhus, are the three standpoints which when being
cross-questioned, being cross-examined, being scrutinized to its conclusion
by the wise, is established on non-doing.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
On the other hand, O bhikkhus, this Dhamma taught by me is irrefutable,
uncorrupted, blameless, undespised by wise samanas and brahmanas. And What,
O bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is irrefutable, uncorrupted,
blameless, undespised by wise samanas and brahmanas. “These are the six
elements”, O bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is
irrefutable, uncorrupted, blameless, undespised by wise samanas or
brahmanas. “These are the six contact domains”, O bhikkhus, is
the Dhamma taught by me that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, blameless,
undespised by wise samanas and brahmanas. “These are the eighteen mental
ponderings”, O bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is
irrefutable, uncorrupted, blameless, undespised by wise samanas and
brahmanas. “These are the four noble truths”, O bhikkhus, is the
Dhamma taught by me that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, blameless, undespised
by wise samanas and brahmanas.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
““These are the six elements”, O bhikkhus, is the Dhamma
taught by me that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, blameless, undespised by wise
samanas and brahmanas.” Yet this was said thus. On account of what
was this said? These, O bhikkhus, are the six elements: the earth element,
the water element, the fire element, the air element, the space element, the
consciousness element. ““These are the six elements”, O
bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is irrefutable, uncorrupted,
blameless, undespised by wise samanas and brahmanas.” That which
was said thus, it is on account of this here that it was said.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
““These are the six contact domains”, O bhikkhus, is the
Dhamma taught by me that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, blameless, undespised
by wise samanas and brahmanas.” Yet this was said thus. On account
of what was this said? These, O bhikkhus, are the six contact domains: the
eye contact domain, the ear contact domain, the nose contact domain, the
tongue contact domain, the body contact domain, the mind contact
domain. ““These are the six contact domains”, O bhikkhus, is
the Dhamma taught by me that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, blameless,
undespised by wise samanas and brahmanas.” That which was said
thus, it is on account of this here that it was said.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
““These are the eighteen mental ponderings”, O bhikkhus, is
the Dhamma taught by me that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, blameless,
undespised by wise samanas and brahmanas.” Yet this was said
thus. On account of what was this said? Having seen forms with the eye, one
ponders a mental pleasure based on forms, one ponders a mental pain based on
forms, one ponders equanimity based on forms. Having heard sounds with the
ear, one ponders a mental pleasure based on sounds, one ponders a mental
pain based on sounds, one ponders equanimity based on sounds. Having smelled
aromas with the nose, one ponders a mental pleasure based on aromas, one
ponders a mental pain based on aromas, one ponders equanimity based on
aromas. Having tasted flavors with the tongue, one ponders a mental pleasure
based on flavors, one ponders a mental pain based on flavors, one ponders
equanimity based on flavors. Having touched tangibles with the body, one
ponders a mental pleasure based on tangibles, one ponders a mental pain
based on tangibles, one ponders equanimity based on tangibles. Having
cognized dhammas with the mind, one ponders a mental pleasure based on
dhammas, one ponders a mental pain based on dhammas, one ponders equanimity
based on dhammas. ““These are the eighteen mental
ponderings”, O bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is
irrefutable, uncorrupted, blameless, undespised by wise samanas and
brahmanas.” That which was said thus, it is on account of this here
that it was said.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
““These are the four noble truths”, O bhikkhus, is the Dhamma
taught by me that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, blameless, undespised by wise
samanas and brahmanas.” Yet this was said thus. On account of what
was this said? Having undertaken the six elements, O bhikkhus, the descent
of the embryo comes to be. There being the descent, there is
name-and-form. In dependence on name-and-form, there is the six-sense
domain, in dependence on the six-sense domain, there is contact, in
dependence on contact, there is feeling. Now O bhikkhus, it is for one
[experiencing] feeling that I declare: “This is suffering”; that
I declare: “This is the origination of suffering”; that I
declare: “This is the cessation of suffering”; that I declare:
“This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, is suffering, a noble truth: Birth is suffering, old
age is also suffering, sickness is also suffering, death is also suffering,
sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental suffering and despair are
also suffering, not to gain that which one wishes for is also suffering, in
brief, the five stocks of appropriations is suffering. This, O bhikkhus, is
called suffering, a noble truth.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, is the origination of suffering, a noble truth? In
dependence on ignorance, there are sankharas. In dependence on sankharas,
there is consciousness. In dependence on consciousness, there is
name-and-form. In dependence on name-and-form, there is the six-sense
domain. In dependence on the six-sense domain, there is contact. In
dependence on contact, there is feeling. In dependence on feeling, there is
thirst. In dependence on thirst, there is holding. In dependence on holding,
there is being. In dependence on being, there is birth. In dependence on
birth, there are old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering,
mental suffering and despair. Just so, is the arising of this entire
amassment of suffering. This, O bhikkhus, is called the origination of
suffering, a noble truth.

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, is the cessation of suffering, a noble truth? From the
complete fading away and cessation of this very ignorance, there is the
cessation of sankharas. From the cessation of sankharas, there is the
cessation of consciousness. From the cessation of consciousness, there is
the cessation of name-and-form. From the cessation of name-and-form, there
is the cessation of the six-sense domain. From the cessation of the
six-sense domain, there is the cessation of contact. From the cessation of
contact, there is the cessation of feeling. From the cessation of feeling,
there is the cessation of thirst. From the cessation of thirst, there is the
cessation of holding. From the cessation of holding, there is the cessation
of being. From the cessation of being, there is the cessation of birth. From
the cessation of birth, there is the cessation of old age and death, sorrow,
lamentation, physical suffering, mental suffering and despair. Just so, is
the cessation of this entire stock of suffering. This, O bhikkhus, is called
the cessation of suffering, a noble truth.

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, is the path leading to the cessation of suffering, a
noble truth? It is just this noble eight-fold path. That is, right view,
right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,
right mindfulness, right samadhi. This, O bhikkhus, is called the path
leading to the cessation of suffering, a noble truth. ““These are the
four noble truths”, O bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is
irrefutable, uncorrupted, blameless, undespised by wise samanas and
brahmanas.” That which was said thus, it is on account of this here
that it was said.
