Whoever, O bhikkhus, might say thus: “In which ever way that a person
creates a kamma, in just that way he experiences.” That being so, O
bhikkhus, there is not the living the life of purity and an opportunity for
rightly making an end of suffering is not evident.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
But whoever, O bhikkhus, might say thus: “In which ever way to be felt
that a person creates a kamma, in just that way he feels the
results.” That being so, O bhikkhus, there is the living the life
of purity and an opportunity for rightly making an end of suffering is
evident.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, for a certain person, even a trifling measure of evil
kamma done leads him to hell. However here, O bhikkhus, for a certain
person, that same trifling measure of evil kamma done is to be felt in this
life without even a tiny [residual] to be seen, what [to speak of] very much
[residual].

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
For what kind of person, O bhikkhus, does even a trifling measure of evil
kamma done lead him to hell?

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain person is undeveloped in body, undeveloped in
virtue, undeveloped in mind, and undeveloped in wisdom. He is
inconsequential, depraved, and dwells in suffering over insignificant
[matters]. For this kind of person, O bhikkhus, even a trifling measure of
evil kamma done lead him to hell?

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
For what kind of person, O bhikkhus, does that same trifling measure of evil
kamma done is to be felt in this life without even a tiny [residual] to be
seen, what [to speak of] very much [residual].

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain person is developed in body, developed in
virtue, developed in mind, and developed in wisdom. He is influential,
magnanimous, and dwells in immeasurable [samadhi]. For this kind of person,
that same trifling measure of evil kamma done is to be felt in this life
without even a tiny [residual] to be seen, what [to speak of] very much
[residual].


<p><span class="parno">8</span>
“Just as, O bhikkhus, a salt crystal were to be dropped in a small cup of
water. So what do you think, O bhikkhus, would such a salt crystal make the
small cup of water salty and undrinkable?”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Yes, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
What is the reason for that?

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
Because, O Bhante, however much water there is in such a small cup, such a
salt crystal would make that water salty and undrinkable.”

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
“Just as, O bhikkhus, a salt crystal were to be dropped in the river
Ganges. So what do you think, O bhikkhus, would such a salt crystal make the
river Ganges salty and undrinkable?”

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
What is the reason for that?

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
“Because, O Bhante, the river Ganges is an expansive body of water, such
a salt crystal would certainly not make that water salty and
undrinkable.”

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
So too, O bhikkhus, here for a certain person, even a trifling measure of
evil kamma done leads him to hell. However here, O bhikkhus, for a certain
person, that same trifling measure of evil kamma done is to be felt in this
life without even a tiny [residual] to be seen, what [to speak of] very much

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain person undergoes imprisonment even for half a
kahapana or for a kahapana or for a hundred kahapanas. However, here a
certain person does not undergo imprisonment even for half a kahapana or for
a kahapana or for a hundred kahapanas.

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
What kind of person, O bhikkhus, undergoes imprisonment even for half a
kahapana or for a kahapana or for a hundred kahapanas?

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain person is poor, with little possessions, with
little wealth. Such a kind of [person], O bhikkhus, undergoes imprisonment
even for half a kahapana or for a kahapana or for a hundred kahapanas.

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
What kind of person, O bhikkhus, does not undergo imprisonment even for half
a kahapana or for a kahapana or for a hundred kahapanas?

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain person is wealthy, with great riches, with great
wealth. Such a kind of [person], O bhikkhus, does not undergo imprisonment
even for half a kahapana or for a kahapana or for a hundred kahapanas.

“Just as, O bhikkhus, a sheep owner or a sheep butcher is able to kill,
imprison, fine, or do with as he likes, some person who is taking a sheep
that is not given, [whereas] he is not able to kill, imprison, fine, or do
with as he likes, another person who is taking a sheep that is not given.

<p><span class="parno">35</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain person is wealthy, with great riches, with great
wealth, like a king or a king's minister. For such a kind of [person], O
bhikkhus, a sheep owner or a sheep butcher is not able to kill, imprison,
fine, or do with, as he likes for taking a sheep that is not given? On the

hand over my sheep or [compensate me for] the sheep's worth.”
