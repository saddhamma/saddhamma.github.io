“There are, O bhikkhus, these five conditions for liberation whereby for
a bhikkhu dwelling ever vigilant, ardent and resolute, his unliberated mind
becomes liberated, his undestroyed asavas become utterly destroyed, he
attains the unattained unsurpassed security from bondage.” Which
five?

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“Here, O bhikkhus, the Teacher or a certain companion in the life of
purity in the position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to a bhikkhu. In
whichever way, O bhikkhus, the Teacher or a certain companion in the life of
purity in the position of a teacher teaches the Dhamma to that bhikkhu, in
just that way, he experiences the meaning in that Dhamma and experiences the
Dhamma. For one who experiences the meaning, experiences the Dhamma, joy is
born. For the joyful, rapture is born. For one of rapturous mind, the body
becomes tranquil. One whose body is tranquil feels pleasure. The mind of one
in pleasure attains samadhi. This, O bhikkhus, is the first condition for
liberation, whereby for a bhikkhu dwelling ever vigilant, ardent and
resolute, his unliberated mind becomes liberated, his undestroyed asavas
become utterly destroyed, he attains the unattained unsurpassed security
from bondage.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“Furthermore, O bhikkhus, indeed not even the Teacher or a certain
companion in the life of purity in the position of a teacher teaches the
Dhamma to the bhikkhu. Rather, he teaches the Dhamma in detail as he has
heard it, as he has learned it. In whichever way, O bhikkhus, that bhikkhu
teaches the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it, as he has learned it, in
just that way, he experiences the meaning in that Dhamma and experiences the
Dhamma. For one who experiences the meaning, experiences the Dhamma, joy is
born. For the joyful, rapture is born. For one of rapturous mind, the body
becomes tranquil. One whose body is tranquil feels pleasure. The mind of one
in pleasure attains samadhi. This, O bhikkhus, is the second condition for
liberation, whereby for a bhikkhu dwelling ever vigilant, ardent and
resolute, his unliberated mind becomes liberated, his undestroyed asavas
become utterly destroyed, he attains the unattained unsurpassed security
from bondage.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
“Furthermore, O bhikkhus, indeed not even the Teacher or a certain
companion in the life of purity in the position of a teacher teaches the
Dhamma to the bhikkhu; nor does he teach the Dhamma in detail as he has
heard it, as he has learned it. Rather, he recites the Dhamma in detail as
he has heard it, as he has learned it. In whichever way, O bhikkhus, that
bhikkhu recites the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it, as he has learned
it, in just that way, he experiences the meaning in that Dhamma and
experiences the Dhamma. For one who experiences the meaning, experiences the
Dhamma, joy is born. For the joyful, rapture is born. For one of rapturous
mind, the body becomes tranquil. One whose body is tranquil feels
pleasure. The mind of one in pleasure attains samadhi. This, O bhikkhus, is
the third condition for liberation, whereby for a bhikkhu dwelling ever
vigilant, ardent and resolute, his unliberated mind becomes liberated, his
undestroyed asavas become utterly destroyed, he attains the unattained
unsurpassed security from bondage.”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“Furthermore, O bhikkhus, indeed not even the Teacher or a certain
companion in the life of purity in the position of a teacher teaches the
Dhamma to the bhikkhu; nor does he teach the Dhamma in detail as he has
heard it, as he has learned it; nor does he recite the Dhamma in detail as
he has heard it, as he has learned it. Rather, he deliberately thinks,
ponders and mentally examines the Dhamma in detail as he has heard it, as he
has learned it. In whichever way, O bhikkhus, that bhikkhu deliberately
thinks, ponders and mentally examines the Dhamma in detail as he has heard
it, as he has learned it, in just that way, he experiences the meaning in
that Dhamma and experiences the Dhamma. For one who experiences the meaning,
experiences the Dhamma, joy is born. For the joyful, rapture is born. For
one of rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One whose body is tranquil
feels pleasure. The mind of one in pleasure attains samadhi. This, O
bhikkhus, is the fourth condition for liberation, whereby for a bhikkhu
dwelling ever vigilant, ardent and resolute, his unliberated mind becomes
liberated, his undestroyed asavas become utterly destroyed, he attains the
unattained unsurpassed security from bondage.”

attended to, well retained in mind, well penetrated with wisdom. In
