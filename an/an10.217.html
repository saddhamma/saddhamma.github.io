“I, O bhikkhus, do not say that [there is] the termination of accumulated
past intentional kamma without having experienced [it], and that is in this
life or in the [next] arising or in some other [arisings] in succession. But
still I, O bhikkhus, do not say [there is] the making of an end of suffering
without having experienced the accumulated past intentional kamma.”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, there is an intentionally unwholesome threefold
corruption and failure in bodily action, yielding suffering, ripening in
suffering. There is an intentionally unwholesome fourfold corruption and
failure in verbal action, yielding suffering, ripening in suffering. There
is an intentionally unwholesome threefold corruption and failure in mental
action, yielding suffering, ripening in suffering.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
But how, O bhikkhus, is there an intentionally unwholesome threefold
corruption and failure in bodily action, yielding suffering, ripening in
suffering.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain person is a killer of living beings. He is
cruel, bloody-handed, violent, devoted to mercilessness towards all living
beings.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
He is a taker of what is not given. Gone to the village or gone to the
forest, he takes the belongings and possessions of others, that which is
reckoned as theft.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
He misconducts [himself] in sensual pleasures. He habitually engages [in
misconduct in sensual pleasures] with such [women] as those protected by
mother, protected by father, protected by mother and father, protected by
brother, protected by sister, protected by relatives, protected by clan,
protected by their dhamma, having a husband, [those whose violation] entails
punishment, and even those engaged to be married.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Thus, O bhikkhus, is the intentionally unwholesome threefold corruption and
failure in bodily action, yielding suffering, ripening in suffering.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
And how, O bhikkhus, is there an intentionally unwholesome fourfold
corruption and failure in verbal action, yielding suffering, ripening in
suffering.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain person is a speaker of falsehood. Gone amidst a
community, or an assembly, or his relations, or a club, or the royal court,
being summoned as a witness [thus], “come good man, tell us what you
know.” He, either not knowing, says: “I know,” or
knowing says: “I don't know,” or not seeing, says: “I
see,” or seeing says: “I don't see.” Thus he speaks a
deliberate lie for his own sake or for the sake of another or for the sake
of some trifling worldly gain.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
He a speaker of divisive speech. Having heard from here, he tells there to
divide these [from those], or having heard from there, he tells here to
divide those [from these]. Thus is he, a breaker of the united, a destroyer
of togetherness. He delights in factions, is delighted with factions,
rejoices in factions, utters speech that creates factions.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
He is a speaker of harsh speech. He utters speech that is harsh, rough,
wrathful, offensive to others, bordering on anger, not leading to samadhi.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
He is a senseless prattler. He speaks at an improper time, [speech that is]
false, meaningless, in accordance with what is not Dhamma, in accordance
with what is not Vinaya, speech not worth treasuring, at the improper time
he utters speech that is unreasonable, speech not worth remembering, speech
connected with loss.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
Thus, O bhikkhus, is the intentionally unwholesome fourfold corruption and
failure in verbal action, yielding suffering, ripening in suffering.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
And how, O bhikkhus, is there an intentionally unwholesome threefold
corruption and failure in mental action, yielding suffering, ripening in
suffering.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain person is covetous. He harbors a wish for the
possessions and belongings of others thus: “O that what belongs to others
would be mine.”

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
He has a mind of ill-will. He harbors corrupted thoughts in mind thus:
“May these beings be killed or captivated or annihilated or destroyed, or
become non-existent.”

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
He is a holder of wrong view and distorted vision [thus]: “There is not
what is offered, there is not what is given, there is not what is
sacrificed. There are no fruits and results of kamma, of what is well done
and badly done. There is not this world, there is not another world, there
is not mother, there is not father, there are no beings from spontaneous
birth, there is not in the world samanas and brahmanas who have come to the
right path, entered upon the right path, those who, having realized by
themselves this world and the other world with supreme knowledge, they cause
to make it known.”

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
Thus, O bhikkhus, is the intentionally unwholesome threefold corruption and
failure in mental action, yielding suffering, ripening in suffering.

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
The intentionally unwholesome threefold corruption and failure in bodily
action is the cause, O bhikkhus, for the arising of beings in the lower
worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane, in hell when the body breaks
up after death. The intentionally unwholesome fourfold corruption and
failure in verbal action is the cause, O bhikkhus, for the arising of beings
in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane, in hell when the
body breaks up after death. The intentionally unwholesome threefold
corruption and failure in mental action is the cause, O bhikkhus, for the
arising of beings in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful
plane, in hell when the body breaks up after death.

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
“Just as, O bhikkhus, a faultless stone thrown up will be clearly well
settled wherever it settles,” So too, O bhikkhus, the intentionally
unwholesome threefold corruption and failure in bodily action is the cause,
for the arising of beings in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the
woeful plane, in hell when the body breaks up after death. The intentionally
unwholesome fourfold corruption and failure in verbal action is the cause,
for the arising of beings in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the
woeful plane, in hell when the body breaks up after death. The intentionally
unwholesome threefold corruption and failure in mental action is the cause,
for the arising of beings in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the
woeful plane, in hell when the body breaks up after death.

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
“I, O bhikkhus, do not say that [there is] the termination of accumulated
past intentional kamma without having experienced [it], and that is in this
life or in the [next] arising or in some other [arisings] in succession. But
still I, O bhikkhus, do not say [there is] the making of an end of suffering
without having experienced the accumulated past intentional kamma.”

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, there is an intentionally wholesome threefold success
in bodily action, yielding pleasure, ripening in pleasure. There is an
intentionally wholesome fourfold success in verbal action, yielding
pleasure, ripening in pleasure. There is an intentionally wholesome
threefold success in mental action, yielding pleasure, ripening in pleasure.

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
And how, O bhikkhus, is there an intentionally wholesome threefold success
in bodily action, yielding pleasure, ripening in pleasure.

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain person, having abandoned the killing of living
beings, abstains from the killing of living beings. Having buried the rod,
having buried the sword, he dwells conscientious, with kindness and
sympathy, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings.

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
Having abandoned the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking
what is not given. Gone to the village or gone to the forest, he does not
take the belongings and possessions of others, that which is reckoned as
theft.

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
Having abandoned misconduct in sensual pleasures, he abstains from
misconduct in sensual pleasures. He does not habitually engage [in
misconduct in sensual pleasures] with such [women] as those protected by
mother, protected by father, protected by mother and father, protected by
brother, protected by sister, protected by relatives, protected by clan,
protected by their dhamma, having a husband, [those whose violation] entails
punishment, and even those engaged to be married.

<p><span class="parno">27</span>
Thus, O bhikkhus, is the intentionally wholesome threefold success in bodily
action, yielding pleasure, ripening in pleasure.

<p><span class="parno">28</span>
And how, O bhikkhus, is there an intentionally wholesome fourfold success in
verbal action, yielding pleasure, ripening in pleasure.

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain person, having abandoned false speech, he
abstains from false speech. Gone amidst a community, or an assembly, or his
relations, or a club, or the royal court, being summoned as a witness
[thus], “come good man, tell us what you know.” He, either not
knowing, says: “I don't know,” or knowing says: “I
know,” or not seeing, says: “I don't see,” or seeing
says: “I see.” Thus he does not speak a deliberate lie for his
own sake or for the sake of another or for the sake of some trifling worldly
gain.

<p><span class="parno">30</span>
Having abandoned divisive speech, he abstains from divisive speech. Having
heard from here, he does not tell there to divide these [from those], or
having heard from there, he does not tell here to divide those [from
these]. Thus is he, a reconciler of the divided, a bestower of
togetherness. He delights in harmony, is delighted with harmony, rejoices in
harmony, utters speech that creates harmony.

<p><span class="parno">31</span>
Having abandoned harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech. That speech
which is gentle, pleasant to the ear, endearing, heartwarming, polite,
pleasing to many, agreeable to many, that form of speech he utters.

<p><span class="parno">32</span>
Having abandoned senseless prattle, he abstains from senseless prattle. He
speaks at the proper time, [speech that is] truthful, meaningful, in
accordance with the Dhamma, in accordance with the Vinaya, speech worth
treasuring, at the proper time he utters speech that is reasonable, speech
worth remembering, speech connected with profit.

<p><span class="parno">33</span>
Thus, O bhikkhus, is the intentionally wholesome fourfold success in verbal
action, yielding pleasure, ripening in pleasure.

<p><span class="parno">34</span>
And how, O bhikkhus, is there an intentionally wholesome threefold success
in mental action, yielding pleasure, ripening in pleasure.

<p><span class="parno">35</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain person is not covetous. He does not harbor a
wish for the possessions and belongings of others thus: “O that what
belongs to others would be mine.”

<p><span class="parno">36</span>
He does not have a mind of ill-will. He does not harbor corrupted thoughts
in mind thus: “May these beings be killed or captivated or annihilated or
destroyed, or become non-existent.”

<p><span class="parno">37</span>
He is a holder of right view and undistorted vision [thus]: “There is
what is offered, there is what is given, there is what is sacrificed. There
are fruits and results of kamma, of what is well done and badly done. There
is this world, there is another world, there is mother, there is father,
there are beings from spontaneous birth, there is in the world samanas and
brahmanas who have come to the right path, entered upon the right path,
those who, having realized by themselves this world and the other world with
supreme knowledge, they cause to make it known.”

<p><span class="parno">38</span>
Thus, O bhikkhus, is the intentionally wholesome threefold success in mental
action, yielding pleasure, ripening in pleasure.

<p><span class="parno">39</span>
The intentionally wholesome threefold success in bodily action is the cause,
O bhikkhus, for the arising of beings in the happy states, in the heavenly
worlds when the body breaks up after death. The intentionally wholesome
fourfold success in verbal action is the cause, O bhikkhus, for the arising
of beings in the happy states, in the heavenly worlds when the body breaks
up after death. The intentionally wholesome threefold success in mental
action is the cause, O bhikkhus, for the arising of beings in the happy
states, in the heavenly worlds when the body breaks up after death.

<p><span class="parno">40</span>
“Just as, O bhikkhus, a faultless stone thrown up will be clearly well
settled wherever it settles,” So too, O bhikkhus, the intentionally
wholesome threefold success in bodily action is the cause for the arising of
beings in the happy states, in the heavenly worlds when the body breaks up
after death. The intentionally wholesome fourfold success in verbal action
is the cause for the arising of beings in the happy states, in the heavenly
worlds when the body breaks up after death. The intentionally wholesome
threefold success in mental action is the cause for the arising of beings in
the happy states, in the heavenly worlds when the body breaks up after
death.”

<p><span class="parno">41</span>
“I, O bhikkhus, do not say that [there is] the termination of accumulated
past intentional kamma without having experienced [it], and that is in this
life or in the [next] arising or in some other [arisings] in succession. But
still I, O bhikkhus, do not say [there is] the making of an end of suffering
without having experienced the accumulated past intentional kamma.”
