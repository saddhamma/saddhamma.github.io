Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling at
Rajagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then, Sutava the wonderer visited with the
Auspicious One. Upon arrival, he exchanged friendly greetings with the
Auspicious One. Having exchange greetings of friendliness and courtesy, he
sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, Sutava the wonderer said
this to the Auspicious One:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
On this one occasion, O Bhante, the Auspicious One was dwelling right here
at Rajagaha, the Mountain Fort. There, O Bhante, this was learned by me in
the presence of the Auspicious One. “The bhikkhu, O Sutava, who is an
arahant, one with asavas destroyed, who has lived [the life of purity], done
what must be done, laid down the burden, attained the true advantage,
completely destroyed the fetters of being, one who is liberated by right
final knowledge, is unable to transgress by five means. The bhikkhu with
asavas destroyed is unable to purposely deprive a living being of life. The
bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to take what is not given, [that
which] is reckoned as theft. The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to
engage in sexual intercourse. The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to
speak a deliberate lie. The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to store
up things to use for enjoyment, as he did formerly while being a
householder.” I hope, O Bhante, this was heard well by me from the
Auspicious One, well learned, well attended to, well remembered.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Certainly, O Sutava, this was heard well by you, well learned, well attended
to, well remembered. Formerly, as well as now, O Sutava, I say thus: “The
bhikkhu, O Sutava, who is an arahant, one with asavas destroyed, who has
lived [the life of purity], done what must be done, laid down the burden,
attained the true advantage, completely destroyed the fetters of being, one
who is liberated by right final knowledge, is unable to transgress by nine
means: The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to purposely deprive a
living being of life. The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to take
what is not given, [that which] is reckoned as theft. The bhikkhu with
asavas destroyed is unable to engage in sexual intercourse. The bhikkhu with
asavas destroyed is unable to speak a deliberate lie. The bhikkhu with
asavas destroyed is unable to store up things to use for enjoyment, as he
did formerly while being a householder.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to disadvow the Buddha. The
bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to disadvow the Dhamma. The bhikkhu
with asavas destroyed is unable to disadvow the Sangha. The bhikkhu with
asavas destroyed is unable to disadvow the training. Formerly, as well as
now, O Sutava, I say thus: “The bhikkhu, O Sutava, who is an arahant, one
with asavas destroyed, who has lived [the life of purity], done what must be
done, laid down the burden, attained the true advantage, completely
destroyed the fetters of being, one who is liberated by right final
knowledge, is unable to transgress by these nine means.”
