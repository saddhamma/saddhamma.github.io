From this they explain among [one] another “non-dhamma as
dhamma.” Beginning with the suttanta method, the extent of the ten
courses of wholesome actions is dhamma, the ten courses of unwholesome
actions is non-dhamma. [Also] “the four establishments of mindfulness,
the four right exertions, the four bases for superhuman powers, the five
faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, the noble eight
factored path”. Thus, the thirty seven bodhipakkhiya dhammas, is
called dhamma. “The three establishments of mindfulness, the three right
exertions, the three bases for superhuman powers, the six faculties, the six
powers, the eight awakening factors, the nine factored path” and
the four appropriations, the five hindrances, the seven underlying
tendencies, and the eight falsehoods, this is called non-dhamma.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
So having siezed whichever one portion of non-dhamma, “we will make this
non-dhamma [become] dhamma. Thus for us, the family of our teacher will be
led out to salvation, and we will be well-known in the world.”
“That non-dhamma as dhamma is the cause.” Indeed, this is the
extent of how they explain non-dhamma as dhamma. Also thus, having siezed
whichever one portion of dhamma saying, “this is non-dhamma,”is
what is meant by: “they explain dhamma as non-dhamma.” However,
by the vinaya method, by true grounds, having reproved, having reminded,
having made a claim as it is, that legal action should be done, this is
called dhamma. By false grounds, not having reproved, not having reminded,
not having made a claim, that legal action should be done, this is called
non-dhamma.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
By the suttanta method, “removal of lust, removal of hate, removal of
delusion, restraint, abandoning, reflection,” this is called
vinaya. Non-depression of lust, non-removal, non-restraint, non-abandoning
non-reflection, this is called non-vinaya. By the vinaya method, “valid
grounds, valid motion declaration, valid proclamation, valid boundary, valid
assembly,” this is called vinaya. “Invalid grounds, invalid
motion declaration, invalid proclamation, invalid boundary, invalid
assembly,” this is called non-vinaya.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
By the suttanta method, the four establishments of mindfulness, the four
right exertions, ...pe... noble eight factored path, this is said by, is
spoken by the Tathagata; The three establishments of mindfulness, the three
right exertions, the three bases for superhuman powers, the six faculties,
the six powers, the eight awakening factors, the nine factored path, this is
not said by, is not spoken by the Tathagata. By the vinaya method, “the
four parajikas, the thirteen sanghadisesas, the two aniyatas, the thirty
nissaggiya pacittiyas,” this is said by, is spoken by the
Tathagata; “The three parajikas, the fourteen sanghadisesas, the three
aniyatas, the thirty one nissaggiya pacittiyas,” this is not said
by, is not spoken by the Tathagata.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
By the suttanta method, “daily entering upon the attainment of fruition,
entering upon the attainment of great compassion, examination of the world
with the Buddha Eye, mastery over the eight attainments, sutta discourses,
talks on birth stories,” this is exemplified [by the
Tathagata]. “Not daily entering upon the attainment of fruition,
...pe... not talks on birth stories,” this is not exemplified [by
the Tathagata]. By the vinaya method, having stayed upon invitation for
entering upon the rains, going away on wandering without having obtained
permission, going away on wandering having celebrated the pavāranā, by first
receiving those visiting with friendliness, this is exemplified [by the
Tathagata]. Only the non-doing of that which is exemplified is called not
exemplified.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
By the suttanta method, the four establishments of mindfulness
...pe... eight factored path, this is called made known; the three
establishments of mindfulness ...pe... the nine factored path, this is
called not made known [by the Tathagata]. By the vinaya method, “the four
parajikas ...pe... thirty nissaggiya pacittiyas,” this is called
made known [by the Tathagata]; “the three parajikas ...pe... the thirty
one nissaggiya pacittiyas,” this is called not made known.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
But this which is said in the end of all suttas: “these cause the true
Dhamma to disappear.” There are five disappearances, called
disappearance of attainments, disappearance of practice, disappearance of
learning, disappearance of signs, disappearance of relics. Therein, the
attainments are: “the four path, the four fruition, the four analytical
knowledges, the triple noble knowledges, and the six higher
knowledges.”. Its dwindling away begins with the dwindling away of
analytical knowledges. Indeed from the final nibbana of the Buddha, they are
capable of causing to bring forth analytical knowledges only for a thousand
years. From there after, the six higher knowledges, from there, even they
cause to bring forth the triple noble knowledges, they are unable to cause
to bring forth. As time goes on, even they become unable to cause to bring
forth dry insight. Only by this means: “a non-returner, a once-returner,
a stream enterer,” in them, their attainment persists and indeed
does not disappear. However, with the last sotāpanna's dissolution of life,
indeed attainment disappearance comes to be. This is called the
dissapearance of attainments.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Indeed [with] the disappearance of practice, they are unable to cause to
bring forth jhana, vipassana, path and fruits. They merely protect the four
purifications of virtue. As time goes on, [thinking]: “having made virtue
go to fulfillment, we must protect [virtue]. There does not exist now
attainments of the noble ones' dhamma, for [one] engaging in striving will
not be able to realize the paths or fruits.” Having met with the
end [of the dispensation], [due to] much laziness, they do not incite one
another, they do not lead, they do not become scrupulous. From there, they
trample on [the vinaya], beginning with the minor disciplinary rules. As
time goes on, they get into the pacittiya and thullaccaya [offences]. From
there, [they commit] grave offenses. Only as much as the parajika
remains. For bhikkhus protecting the four parajikas, even a hundred, even a
thousand, the practice lasts and indeed does not come to
disappearance. However, with the last bhikkhu's breach of virtue or
dissolution of life, indeed practice disappearance comes to be. “This is
called the dissapearance of practice.”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
“Learning,” the three pitakas, Buddha's words, the Teacher's
talks, pali. To the extent that it stands, to that extent learning indeed
goes to fulfillment. As time goes on, the king's commands become
unrighteous, in those [unrighteous kindoms] the royal ministers become
unrighteous. From there, those dwelling in the town and country-side [become
unrighteous]. For their unrighteousness, the [rain] deva does not [pour
down] proper rainfall. Because of that the crops do not prosper. Among those
not prospering, supporters of bhikkhu sangha's requisites are not able to
give. From the bhikkhus becoming weary [due to shortness of] requisites,
they are not able to [pass on] the compilations to apprentices. As time goes
on, learning dwindles away, with [this] special reason they are not able to
bear [the learning] in mind. They only bear the pali language in mind. From
there, as time goes on, they are not able to bear in mind the entire pali
too, first abhidhamma pitaka dwindles away, beginning with the outlines
dwindling away. Indeed first, the great literary works of the  paṭṭhāna
dwindles away, then the yamaka dwindles away, then the point of dispute, the
concept of individuals, the explanation of the elements and the
classification of kind treatments of the dhamma.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Thus the abhidhamma pitaka [having] dwindled away [starting] from the
outlines, the dwindling away of the suttanta piṭaka begins. Indeed first,
the anguttara nikaya dwindles away. Within that too, first the book of
elevens. From there, the book of tens ...pe... from there the book of
ones. Thus the anguttara nikaya [having] dwindled away [starting] from the
outlines, the dwindling away of the samyutta nikaya begins. Indeed first,
the great chapter dwindles away. From there the six sense domains chapter,
the aggregates chapter, the cause chapter, the heavens chapter. Thus the
samyutta nikaya [having] dwindled away [starting] from the outlines, the
dwindling away of the majjhima nikaya begins. Indeed first, the upper fifty
book dwindles away. From there, the middle fifty book. From there, the root
fifty book. Thus the majjhima nikaya [having] dwindled away [starting] from
the outlines, the dwindling away of the digha nikaya begins. Indeed first,
the pāthika chapter dwindles away. From there, the great chapter. From
there, the aggregate of virtue chapter. Thus, the dwindling away of the
digha nikaya is called the dwindling away of the suttanta pitaka. They bear
in mind only the vinaya pitaka and the jataka. Being consciencious, they
bear the vinaya pitaka in mind. However, desiring gain, considering that
“those who boasts of the suttanta do not exist,” they only bear
the jataka in mind. As time goes on, they are not able to bear in mind the
jataka too. So first, the vessantara jataka dwindles away. From there, from
the paṭilomakkama to the punnaka jataka, the great narada jataka. In the
end, the apannaka jātaka dwindles away. Thus the jataka [having] dwindled
away, they only bear in mind the vinaya pitaka.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
As time goes on, the vinaya piṭaka too dwindles away, starting with the
outlines. Indeed first, the old commentaries dwindle away. From there,
gradually, the khandhaka, the bhikkhuni vibhanga, the great vibhaṅga. They
bear in mind only the aggregate of uposatha kamatta. That then is how the
disappearance of learning comes to be. However, to the extent that among
humans, four-line stanza remains, to that extent the non-disappearance of
learning comes to be. “When a faithful and devoted king, having placed a
thousand bags [worth] of gold in a casket on the back of an elephant, having
caused one of the king's service men to roam the city and have a drum beaten
to announce: “Anyone who knows a four-line stanza of the Buddha's words
can acquire this thousand bags worth of gold.” If the king's
service man announces up to the third time [so that] those who did not hear
will hear, but no learned person obtains [the gold] and the king's service
man again returns that thousand bags [worth of gold] to the royal family,
then indeed learning disappearance comes to be. This is called the
disappearance of learning.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
As time goes on, the taking of robes, the taking of bowl, bending back and
stretching out, looking forward and looking backwards do not become
graceful. As if [they are] the Nigantha ascetics, the bhikkhus attained long
white gourd and bowl, having taken and put on the top of their arms, they
wander, it is to this extent too, only the sign's non-disappearance comes to
be. However, as time goes on, from the top of their arms having lowered
down, having hanged down by the hand or by string they wander. The robe too
not having made proper dye having spread over the color, they wander. As
time goes on, they do not dye [the robes]. Having made a mere resemblance of
the ten cutting and the waist-band piercing, they use. Later on, they do not
[even] make a resemblance of the waist-band having pierced. From there too,
not having made the ten cuttings, they go about as if wanderers. As time
goes on, [thinking]: “what is the benefit for us in this way?”
small peace of yellow robe on hand or or having tied around the neck, they
sew on the hair of the head, or having prepared for the livelihood of
plowing and sowing, maintenance of a wife, they wander. Then on the account
of these they give the giving of offerings to the Sangha. It is with
reference to this that the Auspicious One said -- “But in the future,
Ananda, there will be members of the clan yellow-robe necked, immoral, evil
natured. For those who bestow gifts on these immoral ones on behalf of the
Sangha, even then I say, O Ananda, that the offering to the Sangha would be
incalculable, would be immeasurable.” (ma. ni. 3.380). From there
as time goes on, they make manifold kamma [thinking]: “What is this? This
is an obstacle for us.” Having cut off the peace of yellow-robe,
they throw it in the forest. At this time, indeed the disappearance of the
sign comes to be. They say of Kassapa of ten powers (Buddha Kassapa): From
the time beginning with the yonas. Having put on white garmet robe, conduct
and practice has happened. This is called the disappearance of the signs.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
Moreover, the disappearance of the relics should be known thus: -- There are
three final nibbanas: the defilements final nibbana, the aggreggates final
nibbana, and the relics final nibbana. So the defilements' final nibbana
came to be at the seat of awakening. The aggregates' final nibbana was in
Kusinara. The relics' final nibbana will be in the future. How? Thence, here
and there the Buddha's relics not obtaining the right worship, by the
strength of resolution non-right worshipers do not go [to the cetiyas]. As
time goes on,  all remaining right worship will not exist. Indeed for the
dispensation at the time of decline on this island of Tambapaṇṇi, all relics
having assembled at the great cetiya, from there, they will go to the island
of Naga Rajayatana cetiya, from there, the seat of awakening. Only from the
dwelling place of the Nagas, also from the deva world, also from the Brahma
world, they will go to the relics at the great seat of awakening. Meanwhile,
even a measure of mustard seed of relics will not disappear. All relics
having assembled at the great grounds under the bodhi tree, having taken on
the form of the Buddha at the grounds under the bodhi tree, will teach
sitting cross-legged in the effigy of the Buddha. The thirty two marks of a
great man and the eighty secondary marks will all shine forth just
perfectly. From there, they will perform the twin-miracle. Having performed
the miracle, they will teach. Then indeed, there will not be any human
beings present at that place. However, all devas from the ten thousand
world-systems having assembled [thinking]: “today is the final nibbana of
the ten powers, from now on is the beginning of darkness here,”
they will lament. Then from the relics-body, fire having originated, will
cause that body to become non-designatable. A net originating from the
relics-body will rise as far as the Brahma world. For even a measure of
mustard seed of relics will not be left, there being just one net. In the
relics' exhaustion having come to a condition will be cut short. Thus, the
relics having caused to show a great splendor, will disappear. Then the deva
sangha of the Buddha will assemble on the day of final nibbana to honor [the
Buddha] with celestial perfumes, flowers, musical instruments, having
circumambulated three times, having payed homage, [thinking]: “We will
gain the coming into existence in the future to see the Buddha, the
Auspicious One.” Having said, it is just not possible going to the
presence [of the Buddha now]. This is called the disappearance of the
relics.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
These five kinds of disappearance are rooted only in the disappearance of
learning. “Because learning's disappearance is the disappearance of
practice. When learning endures, practice remains.” Even on this
island, [there was the great disaster known as] Candalatissa, the great
fear. Sakka, the king of the gods, having constructed a great raft for the
bhikkhus, foretold of the great fear that will befall [the island]: “The
[rain] deva will not [pour down] proper rainfall. The bhikkhus will become
weary [due to shortness of] requisites, they will not be able to bear in
mind their learning. It is proper for you masters to protect your lives
having gone to the other shore. Having ascended this great raft, you must
go, venerable sirs. For those who are here, it is not possible to stay, not
adequate. For you having set aside even a chip splinter in the chest, you
must go [so that] the entire fear will be avoided.” Then having
reached the ocean shore, sixty bhikkhus having made an agreement [said]:
“For us here this journey is not to be done. Having remained here, only
we must protect the tipitaka.” Having remained behind, having gone
to the mountainous country on the southern region [of Sri Lanka], they lived
sustaining their livelihood on tubers and roots. Those bearing a body [of
scriptures], having sat down, they rehearsed. Those not bearing [a body of
scriptures], having raised sand [to beautify the place] attended upon the
leaders, having made it possible for those ones to thoroughly learn the
scriptures. In this way, by this method they completed the memorization of
the Teacher's talks in the three pitakas in twelve years.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
With fear allayed, the seven hundred bhikkhus themselves not causing even
one syllable of the Teacher's talks in the three pitakas to disappear, gone
to the place in just this island country belonging to Kallagama village,
entered the Mandalarama vihara. Upon the elders arrival, having heard: on
this island sixty bhikkhus were left behind, [said]: “we must see the
elders.” Having gone to the elders with the three pitakas purified,
indeed they did not see even one syllable not in agreement. For the elders
in that place this talk arose: “Is learning or practice the root of the
dispensation?” The pamsukulika elders said: “practice is the
root.” The dhamma speakers [said]: “Learning [is the
root].” Then many elders said: “Even for you two, we will not
make a person [victorious] by mere speech only. You must bring forth
[quotes] from the suttas [to gain] victory by what is spoken.”
“To bring forth [a quote] from the suttas is not a burden,”
[said the pamsukulika elders] “But Subhadda, if the bhikkhus dwell
rightly, the world will not be empty of arahants.”
(dī. ni. 2.214). “Practice is the root of the Teacher's dispensation, O
great king, practice is its essence. By practice it persists, it
remains.” (mi. pa. 4.1.7) They brought forth [these quotes from]
the suttas. Having heard this sutta the dhamma speakers brought forth these
verses for their own doctrinal position. --

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “For as long as suttanta remains, as long as vinaya shines.<br> For that
long they see the light, just as the sun rises.<br> In the suttanta's
non-existence, and the vinaya forgotten, <br> the world will be in darkness,
just as the sun's disappearance.<br> In the suttanta being so protected, the
practice comes to be protected.<br> With the endurance of the practice, the
wise ones release from attachments, do not perish.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
When these verses were brought forth, the pamsukulika elders became
silent. Only the dhamma speaker elders words were first-placed. “Indeed
just as between a breed of hundred or thousand bulls there is not a [single]
cow in that lineage, its succession is not going to be continued. So too for
a bhikkhu who has begun to win insight, even for a hundred bhikkhus, even
for a thousand bhikkhus, if there is not learning [of the scriptures]
existing, indeed there is not the noble path penetration. And just as a
syllable put down on the surface of a stone to make known [the location] of
a treasure-pot, for as long as the syllable remains, indeed that long the
treasure-pot is not lost. Just so, [as long as] learning lasts, the
dispensation does not disappear.”
