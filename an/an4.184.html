Then, the brahmin Janussoni visited with the Auspicious One. Upon arrival,
he exchanged friendly greetings with the Auspicious One. Having exchanged
friendly greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side. Having sat
down to one side, the brahmin Janussoni said this to the Auspicious One:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Indeed I, O Master Gotama, am one of such doctrine, such view: “There is
not one who, not fearing being liable to death, is not afraid of the
undergoing of death.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
There are, O brahmin, those who, fearing being liable to death, are afraid
of the undergoing of death. However, O brahmin, there are those who, not
fearing being liable to death, are not afraid of the undergoing of death.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
And who, O brahmin, fearing being liable to death, is afraid of the
undergoing of death?

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Here, O brahmin, a certain one is not rid of lust, not rid of desire, not
rid of affection, not rid of thirst, not rid of fever, not rid of greed in
sensual pleasures. A severe disease or sickness is contacted by that certain
one. It occurs to that certain one contacted by the severe disease or
sickness thus: “Alas, the sensual pleasures that are dear will abandon
me, or I will abandon the sensual pleasures that are dear!” He
grieves, becomes distressed, laments, wails beating his breast, falls into
confusion. This, O brahmin, is one who, fearing being liable to death, is
afraid of the undergoing of death.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Furthermore, O brahmin, here a certain one is not rid of lust, not rid of
desire, not rid of affection, not rid of thirst, not rid of fever, not rid
of greed for the body. A severe disease or sickness is contacted by that
certain one. It occurs to that certain one contacted by the severe disease
or sickness thus: “Alas, the body that is dear will abandon me, or I will
abandon the body that is dear!” He grieves, becomes distressed,
laments, wails beating his breast, falls into confusion. This, O brahmin, is
one who, fearing being liable to death, is afraid of the undergoing of
death.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Furthermore, O brahmin, here a certain one has not done good [deeds], has
not done wholesome [deeds], has not made a refuge for the fearful. One who
has done evil [deeds], done cruel [deeds], done wrong-doing. A severe
disease or sickness is contacted by that certain one. It occurs to that
certain one contacted by the severe disease or sickness thus: “Alas, I
have not done good [deeds], not done wholesome [deeds], not made refuge for
the fearful. [I have] done evil [deeds], done cruel [deeds], done
wrong-doing. Sir, as far as the destiny of those who have not done good
[deeds], not done wholesome [deeds], not made refuge for the fearful, [who
have] done evil [deeds], done cruel [deeds], done wrong-doing, that destiny
I must go after death!” He grieves, becomes distressed, laments,
wails beating his breast, falls into confusion. This, O brahmin, is one who,
fearing being liable to death, is afraid of the undergoing of death.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Furthermore, O brahmin, here a certain one is uncertain, is one who has
doubt, is one who has not reached accomplishment in the true Dhamma. A
severe disease or sickness is contacted by that certain one. It occurs to
that certain one contacted by the severe disease or sickness thus: “Alas,
I am one who is uncertain, one who has doubt, one who has not reached
accomplishment in the true Dhamma!” He grieves, becomes distressed,
laments, wails beating his breast, falls into confusion. This, O brahmin, is
one who, fearing being liable to death, is afraid of the undergoing of
death.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
These, O brahmin, are the four who, fearing being liable to death, are
afraid of the undergoing of death.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
 And who, O brahmin, not fearing being liable to death, is not afraid of the
undergoing of death? Here, O brahmin, a certain one is rid of lust, rid of
desire, rid of affection, rid of thirst, rid of fever, rid of greed in
sensual pleasures. A severe disease or sickness is contacted by that certain
one. It does not occur to that certain one contacted by the severe disease
or sickness thus: “Alas, the sensual pleasures that are dear will abandon
me, or I will abandon the sensual pleasures that are dear!” He does
not grieve, does not become distressed, does not lament, does not wail
beating his breast, does not fall into confusion. This, O brahmin, is one
who, not fearing being liable to death, is not afraid of the undergoing of
death.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
Furthermore, O brahmin, here a certain one is rid of lust, rid of desire,
rid of affection, rid of thirst, rid of fever, rid of greed for the body. A
severe disease or sickness is contacted by that certain one. It does not
occur to that certain one contacted by the severe disease or sickness thus:
“Alas, the body that is dear will abandon me, or I will abandon the body
that is dear!” He does not grieve, does not become distressed, does
not lament, does not wail beating his breast, does not fall into
confusion. This, O brahmin, is one who, not fearing being liable to death,
is not afraid of the undergoing of death.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
Furthermore, O brahmin, here a certain one has not done evil [deeds], not
done cruel [deeds], not done wrong-doing. [He has] done good [deeds], has
done wholesome [deeds], has made a refuge for the fearful. A severe disease
or sickness is contacted by that certain one. It occurs to that certain one
contacted by the severe disease or sickness thus: “Alas, I have not done
evil [deeds], not done cruel [deeds], not done wrong-doing. [I have] done
good [deeds], done wholesome [deeds], made refuge for the fearful. Sir, as
far as the destiny of those who have not done evil [deeds], not done cruel
[deeds], not done wrong-doing, [who have] done good [deeds], done wholesome
[deeds], made refuge for the fearful, that destiny I must go after
death!” He does not grieve, does not become distressed, does not
lament, does not wail beating his breast, does not fall into
confusion. This, O brahmin, is one who, not fearing being liable to death,
is not afraid of the undergoing of death.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
Furthermore, O brahmin, here a certain one is not uncertain, is not one who
has doubt, is one who has reached accomplishment in the true Dhamma. A
severe disease or sickness is contacted by that certain one. It occurs to
that certain one contacted by the severe disease or sickness thus: “Alas,
I am one who is not uncertain, one who has no doubt, one who has reached
accomplishment in the true Dhamma!” He does not grieve, does not
become distressed, does not lament, does not wail beating his breast, does
not fall into confusion. This, O brahmin, is one who, not fearing being
liable to death, is not afraid of the undergoing of death.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
These, O brahmin, are the four who, not fearing being liable to death, are
not afraid of the undergoing of death.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
Excellent, O Master Gotama! Excellent, O Master Gotama! Just as, O Master
Gotama, one might set upright what has been overturned, or open up what has
been closed, or show a path to one who is lost, or bear an oil lamp in the
darkness so that those with good eyesight can see forms, just so has the
Dhamma been explained by the venerable Gotama in countless ways. I go, to
the Auspicious Gotama, as refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of
bhikkhus. May  Master Gotama bear it in mind, that I am a lay disciple who
has gone for refuge from today for as long as life lasts.
