At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jetavana,
Anathapindika's park. At that time the venerable Nandaka was instructing,
arousing, energizing, and gladdening the bhikkhus at the assembly hall with
a Dhamma talk.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Then in the evening, the Auspicious One emerged from seclusion and
approached the assembly hall. Having approached, he stood outside the closed
door waiting for the talk to finish. Then having known that the talk was
finished, having coughed, the Auspicious One knocked on the bolt. A bhikkhu
opened the door for the Auspicious One. The Auspicious One entered the
assembly hall. Having entered, he sat down on a prepared seat. Having sat
down, the Auspicious One said this to the venerable Nandaka. “You gave
the bhikkhus a long Dhamma discourse, Nandaka. My back was even aching while
I stood outside the closed door waiting for the talk to finish.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
When thus was said, the venerable Nandaka became disheartened and said this
to the Auspicious One. “O Bhante, indeed I did not know that the
Auspicious One was standing outside the closed door. Certainly, O Bhante, if
I would have known that the Auspicious One was standing outside the closed
door, we would not have explained too long.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Then the Auspicious One having known the venerable Nandaka's disheartening,
said this to the venerable Nandaka. Good good Nandaka. It is fitting, O
Nandaka, for you young clansman who have gone forth out of faith from the
house life into homelessness  to talk on the Dhamma thus, when you have
settled. When you assemble, O Nandaka, two things are to be done; Either
talk on the Dhamma or maintain noble silence.
