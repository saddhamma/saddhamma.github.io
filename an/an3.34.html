There are, O bhikkhus, these three sources for the origination of
kamma. What three? Greed is a source for the origination of kamma, hatred is
a source for the origination of kamma, delusion is a source for the
origination of kamma.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Whatever kamma, O bhikkhus, is fashioned by greed, born of greed, with greed
as its source, with greed as its origin, wherever self-begetting is
actualized, it is there that the kamma ripens. Wherever that kamma ripens,
it is there that the results are experienced, either in this life or in the
[next] arising or in some other [arisings] in succession.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Whatever kamma, O bhikkhus, is fashioned by hatred, born of hatred, with
hatred as its source, with hatred as its origin, wherever self-begetting is
actualized, it is there that the kamma ripens. Wherever that kamma ripens,
it is there that the results are experienced, either in this life or in the
[next] arising or in some other [arisings] in succession.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Whatever kamma, O bhikkhus, is fashioned by delusion, born of delusion, with
delusion as its source, with delusion as its origin, wherever self-begetting
is actualized, it is there that the kamma ripens. Wherever that kamma
ripens, it is there that the results are experienced, either in this life or
in the [next] arising or in some other [arisings] in succession.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Just as, O bhikkhus, seeds that are unbroken, unspoiled, undamaged by wind
and sun, fertile, well kept, is put down on a well prepared soil in a good
field, and the [rain] deva might supply appropriate rain shower, thus, O
bhikkhus, those seeds would undergo growth, increase and abundance.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
So too, O bhikkhus, whatever kamma is fashioned by greed, born of greed,
with greed as its source, with greed as its origin, wherever self-begetting
is actualized, it is there that the kamma ripens. Wherever that kamma
ripens, it is there that the results are experienced, either in this life or
in the [next] arising or in some other [arisings] in succession.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Whatever kamma, is fashioned by hatred, born of hatred, with hatred as its
source, with hatred as its origin, wherever self-begetting is actualized, it
is there that the kamma ripens. Wherever that kamma ripens, it is there that
the results are experienced, either in this life or in the [next] arising or
in some other [arisings] in succession.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Whatever kamma, is fashioned by delusion, born of delusion, with delusion as
its source, with delusion as its origin, wherever self-begetting is
actualized, it is there that the kamma ripens. Wherever that kamma ripens,
it is there that the results are experienced, either in this life or in the
[next] arising or in some other [arisings] in succession. These, O bhikkhus,
are the three sources for the origination of kamma.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, these three sources for the origination of
kamma. What three? Non-greed is a source for the origination of kamma,
non-hatred is a source for the origination of kamma, non-delusion is a
source for the origination of kamma.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Whatever kamma, O bhikkhus, is fashioned by non-greed, born of non-greed,
with non-greed as its source, with non-greed as its origin, that kamma is
abandoned when greed is eliminated. It is cut off at the root, made like
palm stump, obliterated so that it is no longer subject to future arising.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
Whatever kamma, O bhikkhus, is fashioned by non-hatred, born of non-hatred,
with non-hatred as its source, with non-hatred as its origin, that kamma is
abandoned when hatred is eliminated. It is cut off at the root, made like
palm stump, obliterated so that it is no longer subject to future arising.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
Whatever kamma, O bhikkhus, is fashioned by non-delusion, born of
non-delusion, with non-delusion as its source, with non-delusion as its
origin, that kamma is abandoned when delusion is eliminated. It is cut off
at the root, made like palm stump, obliterated so that it is no longer
subject to future arising.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
Just as, O bhikkhus, that there are seeds that are unbroken, unspoiled,
undamaged by wind and sun, fertile, well kept. A man would burn them in a
fire, having burnt it in a fire, he would make them ashes. having made them
ashes, he would winnow them in a strong wind or he would cause them to be
carried away in a swift flowing river. Thus, O bhikkhus, those seeds would
be cut off at the root, made like palm stump, obliterated so that they are
no longer subject to future arising.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
So too, O bhikkhus, whatever kamma, fashioned by non-greed, born of
non-greed, with non-greed as its source, with non-greed as its origin, that
kamma is abandoned when greed is eliminated. It is cut off at the root, made
like palm stump, obliterated so that it is no longer subject to future
arising.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
Whatever kamma, is fashioned by non-hatred, born of non-hatred, with
non-hatred as its source, with non-hatred as its origin, that kamma is
abandoned when hatred is eliminated. It is cut off at the root, made like
palm stump, obliterated so that it is no longer subject to future arising.

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
Whatever kamma, is fashioned by non-delusion, born of non-delusion, with
non-delusion as its source, with non-delusion as its origin, that kamma is
abandoned when delusion is eliminated. It is cut off at the root, made like
palm stump, obliterated so that it is no longer subject to future
arising. These, O bhikkhus, are the three sources for the origination of
kamma.

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

“Whatever kamma has been done,<br> born of greed, born of hatred,<br> born of
delusion, by which an ignorant person [has come to be];<br> whether little or
much,<br> [all] that is to be felt right here;<br> other ground for it does not
exist.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

Therefore [with this] greed and hatred,<br> and also delusion borne [body];<br>
the wise bhikkhu giving rise to noble knowledge,<br> abandons all bad
destinations.”
