At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling in Bhoganagara at the Ananda
shrine. At that place the Auspicious One addressed the
bhikkhus. “Bhikkhus.” “Yes Bhante.” Those bhikkhus
replied to the Auspicious One. The Auspicious One said this:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“O bhikkhus, I will teach you these four great references. Listen to that
and do mind it well, I will speak.”. “Yes Bhante,”
those bhikkhus replied to the Auspicious One. The Auspicious One said this:
And what, O bhikkhus, are the four great references?

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“Here, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might say thus: “O friends, in the
presence of the Auspicious One, this was heard by me, this was received in
his presence. This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher's
instructions.” For him, O bhikkhus, that bhikkhu's words should
simply not be delighted in, should not be rejected. Not having delighted in,
not having rejected, having thoroughly learned his words and phrases, those
[words and phrases] should be descended into the suttas, pointed out in the
Vinaya. If those are being made to fit in with the suttas, those are being
pointed out in the Vinaya, but cannot even descend into the suttas, cannot
be pointed out in the vinaya, then you must reach this conclusion here:
Certainly, this is just not the words of the Auspicious One, the arahant,
the rightly self-awakened one. This bhikkhu has learned them
incorrectly. Thus, O bhikkhus, this must be discarded by you.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Or else here, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might say thus: “O friends, in the

pointed out in the vinaya, then you must reach this conclusion here:
Certainly, this is just the words of the Auspicious One, the arahant, the
rightly self-awakened one. This bhikkhu has learned them correctly. This, O
bhikkhus, is the first great reference that you should bear in mind.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Or else here, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might say thus: “Indeed in such and
such dwelling place, a sangha dwells with an eminent elder. In the presence
of that Sangha, this was heard by me, this was received in their
presence. This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher's
instructions.” For him, O bhikkhus, that bhikkhu's words should

Or else here, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might say thus: “Indeed in such and
such dwelling place, many elder bhikkhus dwell, who are well-learned,
experts on the discourses, bearers of the Dhamma, bearers of the Vinaya,
bearers of the outlines. In the presence of those elders, this was heard by
me, this was received in their presence. This is the Dhamma, this is the
Vinaya, this is the Teacher's instructions.” For him, O bhikkhus,
that bhikkhu's words should simply not be delighted in, should not be
rejected. Not having delighted in, not having rejected, having thoroughly
