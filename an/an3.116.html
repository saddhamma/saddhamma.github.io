These three individuals, O bhikkhus, are to be found existing in the
world. Which three?

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, from the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, from
the extinquishing of perceptions of resistance, from non-attention to
perceptions of diversity, “space is infinite,” a certain
individual enters and dwells in the domain of infinite space. He enjoys
that, strives after that, and enters upon happiness by that. Settled
therein, resolved on that, a frequent dweller in that, not fallen away from
it when passing away, he rises in companionship of the devas pertaining to
the domain of infinite space.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
For the devas pertaining to the domain of infinite space, O bhikkhus, their
lifespan is twenty thousand aeons. The puthujjana, having remained there as
long as life lasts, having spent as much as all that deva lifespan, even
goes to hell, even goes to the animal womb, even goes to the sphere of
ghost. But for the Auspicious One's disciple, having remained there as long
as life last, having spent as much as all that deva lifespan, simply attains
nibbana at that place.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
This, O bhikkhus, is the distinction, this is the disparity, this is the
difference between the one to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] comes to be,
the noble disciple, and the one to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not
come to be, the puthujjana, that is when there is future destination,
reappearance.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, here, having completely surmounted the domain of
infinite space, “consciousness is infinite,” a certain
individual enters upon and abides in the domain of infinite
consciousness. He enjoys that, strives after that, and enters upon happiness
by that. Settled therein, resolved on that, a frequent dweller in that, not
fallen away from it when passing away, he rises in companionship of the
devas pertaining to the domain of infinite consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
For the devas pertaining to the domain of infinite consciousness, O
bhikkhus, their lifespan is forty thousand aeons. The puthujjana, having
remained there as long as life lasts, having spent as much as all that deva
lifespan, even goes to hell, even goes to the animal womb, even goes to the
sphere of ghost. But for the Auspicious One's disciple, having remained
there as long as life last, having spent as much as all that deva lifespan,
simply attains nibbana at that place.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
This, O bhikkhus, is the distinction, this is the disparity, this is the
difference between the one to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] comes to be,
the noble disciple, and the one to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not
come to be, the puthujjana, that is when there is future destination,
reappearance.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, here, having completely surmounted the domain of
infinite consciousness, “there is nothing,” a certain individual
enters upon and abides in the domain of nothingness. He enjoys that, strives
after that, and enters upon happiness by it. Settled therein, resolved on
it, a frequent dweller in that, not fallen away from it when passing away,
he rises in companionship of the devas pertaining to the domain of
nothingness.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
For the devas pertaining to the domain of nothingness, O bhikkhus, their
lifespan is sixty thousand aeons. The puthujjana, having remained there as
long as life lasts, having spent as much as all that deva lifespan, even
goes to hell, even goes to the animal womb, even goes to the sphere of
ghost. But for the Auspicious One's disciple, having remained there as long
as life last, having spent as much as all that deva lifespan, simply attains
nibbana at that place.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
This, O bhikkhus, is the distinction, this is the disparity, this is the
difference between the one to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] comes to be,
the noble disciple, and the one to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not
come to be, the puthujjana, that is when there is future destination,
reappearance.
