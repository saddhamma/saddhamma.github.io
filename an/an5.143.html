At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling at Vesali in the Great Wood, at
the Hall with the Peaked Roof. Then in the morning, the Auspicious One
having dressed, having taken bowl and robe, entered Vesali for alms food.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
At that time, as much as five hundred Licchavis, having assembled at the
Sarandada shrine, this topic of conversation arose as they settled: “The
appearance of five gems are rare in the world. Which five? The elephant
gem's appearance is rare in the world. The horse gem's appearance is rare in
the world. The jewel gem's appearance is rare in the world. The woman gem's
appearance is rare in the world. The head of household gem's appearance is
rare in the world. The appearance of these five gems are rare in the
world.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
So then, those Licchavis placed a man on the road [and said], “If you,
good man, were to see the Auspicious One approaching, then you should inform
us.” The man saw the Auspicious One approaching from afar. Having
seen, he went to those Licchavis. Upon arrival, he said this to those
Licchavis: “Honorables, here comes that Auspicious One, the Arahant, the
rightly self-awakened One. Now is the time for you to do as you think
fit.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
So then, those Licchavis went to the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, they
bowed down to the Auspicious One and sat down to one side. Having sat down
to one side, those Licchavis said this to the Auspicious One: “It would
be good, O Bhante, if the Auspicious One would approach the Sarandada
shrine, out of compassion.” The Auspicious One consented by
silence. So then, the Auspicious One went to the Sarandada shrine. Upon
arrival, he sat down on a prepared seat. Having sat down, the Auspicious One
said this to those Licchavis:

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“What discussion, O Licchavis, were you having now as you have settled
here? And what was the talk underway that was left unfinished by
you?” Here, O Bhante, having assembled, this topic of conversation
arose as we settled: “The appearance of five gems are rare in the
world. Which five? The elephant gem's appearance is rare in the world. The
horse gem's appearance is rare in the world. The jewel gem's appearance is
rare in the world. The woman gem's appearance is rare in the world. The head
of household gem's appearance is rare in the world. The appearance of these
five gems are rare in the world.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Surely, intent on sensual pleasures, for you Licchavis, only talk concerning
sensual pleasures arose between you.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
“The appearance of five gems, O Licchavis, are rare in the world. Which
five? The appearance of the Tathagata, the arahant, the rightly
self-awakened One is rare in the world. An individual who can teach the
Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata is rare in the world. When
the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata has been taught, an
individual who can understand it is rare in the world. When the Dhamma and
discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata has been taught and understood, an
individual who practices the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma is rare in
the world. An appreciative and grateful individual is rare in the world. The
appearance of these five gems, O Licchavis, are rare in the world.\char`
