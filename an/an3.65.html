<p><span class="parno">1</span>
At one time the Auspicious One was wandering on tour in Kosala with a large
Sangha of bhikkhus when they arrived at the market town of the Kalamas named
Kesaputta. The Kalamas of Kesaputta heard: “The samana Gotama, son of the
Sakyans, having gone forth from the Sakyan clan, has arrived at
Kessaputta. Now a good reputation has been spread about that Auspicious
Gotama thus: “Truly is he the Auspicious One, the Arahant, rightly
self-awakened, excelling in knowledge and conduct, well-farer, knower of
worlds, incomparable charioteer of tamed persons, teacher of devas and
humans, awakened, auspicious.” Having realized this world with its
devas, maras and brahmas, together with the population of samanas and
brahmanas, devas and humans, he causes to make it known. He teaches the
Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end,
with the right meaning and phrasing, making known the life of purity that is
utterly perfect and pure. Now good is the sight of such arahants.”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
So then, the Kalamas of Kesaputta went to see the Auspicious One. Upon
arrival, some having bowed down to the Auspicious One, sat down to one
side. Some having exchanged friendly greetings and cordial talk with the
Auspicious One, sat down to one side. Some having put their palms together
in anjali [in reverence] to the Auspicious One, sat down to one side. Some
having announced their name and clan, sat down to one side. Some having kept
silent, sat down to one side. Then the Kalamas, of Kesaputta said this to
the Auspicious One: There are, O Bhante, some samanas and brahmanas who upon
coming to Kesaputta, they explain and elucidate only their own doctrine but
they ridicule, disparage, revile and despise the doctrines of others. Then
there are other samanas and brahmanas who upon coming to Kesaputta, they
explain and elucidate only their own doctrine but they ridicule, disparage,
revile and despise the doctrines of others. Regarding this, O Bhante, we
indeed have perplexity, we have doubt at to which among these venerable
samanas and brahmanas are speaking the truth, and which are speaking a
lie?”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
It is indeed enough, O kalamas, for you to doubt; enough to be
perplexed. For certainly, doubt has arisen for you on a perplexing
subject. “Come you, O Kalamas, do not go by tradition, do not go by
lineage, do not go by hearsay, do not go by the handing down of scriptures,
do not go by logical reasoning, do not go by inferential reasoning, do not
go by mode of reasoning, do not go by submission to view after reflection,
do not go by suitability of appearance, do not go by “[because] the
samana is our teacher.” When, O Kalamas, you know for yourself,
these dhammas are unwholesome, these dhammas are blameworthy, these dhammas
are censured by the wise, these dhammas when taken upon oneself leads to
harm and suffering, then you abandon them.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
What do you think, O Kalamas? “When greed is arising in a person, does it
arise for his welfare or harm?”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Harm, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
“But a greedy person, O Kalamas, with his mind overwhelmed and obssessed
by greed, kills living beings, also takes what is not given, also goes to
others wives, also speaks falsehood, and causes others to do likewise, which
lead to his harm and suffering for a long time.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
That is so, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
What do you think, O Kalamas? “When hatred is arising in a person, does
it arise for his welfare or harm?”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Harm, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
“But an angry person, O Kalamas, with his mind overwhelmed and obssessed
by anger, kills living beings, also takes what is not given, also goes to
others wives, also speaks falsehood, and causes others to do likewise, which
lead to his harm and suffering for a long time.”

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
That is so, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
What do you think, O Kalamas? “When delusion is arising in a person, does
it arise for his welfare or harm?”

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
Harm, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
“But a deluded person, O Kalamas, with his mind overwhelmed and obssessed
by delusion, kills living beings, also takes what is not given, also goes to
others wives, also speaks falsehood, also causes others to do likewise,
which lead to his harm and suffering for a long time.”

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
That is so, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
What do you think, O Kalamas? “Are these dhammas wholesome or
unwholesome?”

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
Unwholesome, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
“Blameworthy or blameless?”

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
Blameworthy, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
“Censured by the wise or praised by the wise?”

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
Censured by the wise, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
“When taken upon oneself, does it lead to harm and suffering or not, or
how [do you see it] here?”

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
“When taken upon oneself, O Bhante, it leads to harm and suffering. [We
see it] here thus.”

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
That which was said thus: “Come you, O Kalamas, do not go by tradition,
do not go by lineage, do not go by hearsay, do not go by the handing down of
scriptures, do not go by logical reasoning, do not go by inferential
reasoning, do not go by mode of reasoning, do not go by submission to view
after reflection, do not go by suitability of appearance, do not go by
“[because] the samana is our teacher.” When, O Kalamas, you know
for yourself, these dhammas are unwholesome, these dhammas are blameworthy,
these dhammas are censured by the wise, these dhammas when taken upon
oneself leads to harm and suffering, then you abandon them,” it was
on account of this here, that it was said.

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
“Come you, O Kalamas, do not go by tradition, do not go by lineage, do
not go by hearsay, do not go by the handing down of scriptures, do not go by
logical reasoning, do not go by inferential reasoning, do not go by mode of
reasoning, do not go by submission to view after reflection, do not go by
suitability of appearance, do not go by “[because] the samana is our
teacher.” When, O Kalamas, you know for yourself, these dhammas are
wholesome, these dhammas are blameless, these dhammas are praised by the
wise, these dhammas when taken upon oneself leads to welfare and happiness,
then having entered upon them you dwell in them.”

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
What do you think, O Kalamas? “When non-greed is arising in a person,
does it arise for his welfare or harm?”

<p><span class="parno">27</span>
For his welfare, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">28</span>
“But a non-greedy person, O Kalamas, with his mind not overwhelmed and
obssessed by greed, does not kill living beings, also does not take what is
not given, also does not go to others wives, also does not speak falsehood,
also does not cause others to do likewise, which lead to his welfare and
happiness for a long time.”

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
That is so, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">30</span>
What do you think, O Kalamas? “When non-hatred is arising in a person,
does it arise for his welfare or harm?”

<p><span class="parno">31</span>
For his welfare, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">32</span>
“But a non-hating person, O Kalamas, with his mind not overwhelmed and
obssessed by hate, does not kill living beings, also does not take what is
not given, also does not go to others wives, also does not speak falsehood,
also does not cause others to do likewise, which lead to his welfare and
happiness for a long time.”

<p><span class="parno">33</span>
That is so, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">34</span>
What do you think, O Kalamas? “When non-delusion is arising in a person,
does it arise for his welfare or harm?”

<p><span class="parno">35</span>
For his welfare, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">36</span>
“But a non-deluded person, O Kalamas, with his mind not overwhelmed and
obssessed by delusion, does not kill living beings, also does not take what
is not given, also does not go to others wives, also does not speak
falsehood, also does not cause others to do likewise, which lead to his
welfare and happiness for a long time.”

<p><span class="parno">37</span>
That is so, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">38</span>
What do you think, O Kalamas? “Are these dhammas wholesome or
unwholesome?”

<p><span class="parno">39</span>
Wholesome, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">40</span>
“Blameworthy or blameless?”

<p><span class="parno">41</span>
Blameless, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">42</span>
“Censured by the wise or praised by the wise?”

<p><span class="parno">43</span>
Praised by the wise, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">44</span>
“When taken upon oneself, does it lead to welfare and happiness or not,
or how [do you see it] here?”

<p><span class="parno">45</span>
“When taken upon oneself, O Bhante, it leads to welfare and
happiness. [We see it] here thus.”

<p><span class="parno">46</span>
That which was said thus: “Come you, O Kalamas, do not go by tradition,
do not go by lineage, do not go by hearsay, do not go by the handing down of
scriptures, do not go by logical reasoning, do not go by inferential
reasoning, do not go by mode of reasoning, do not go by submission to view
after reflection, do not go by suitability of appearance, do not go by
“[because] the samana is our teacher.” When, O Kalamas, you know
for yourself, these dhammas are wholesome, these dhammas are blameless,
these dhammas are praised by the wise, these dhammas when taken upon oneself
leads to welfare and happiness, then having entered upon them you dwell in
them,” it was on account of this here, that it was said.

<p><span class="parno">47</span>
That noble disciple, O Kalamas, thus rid of covetousness, rid of ill-will,
unconfused, mindful and contemplative, with a mind imbued with metta, dwells
pervading one direction, likewise the second direction, likewise the third
direction, likewise the fourth direction, above, below, around, to all
beings in the entire world he dwells pervading with a mind imbued with
metta, abundant, grown great, boundless, and free from enmity and ill-will.

<p><span class="parno">48</span>
With a mind imbued with compassion, he dwells pervading one direction,
likewise the second direction, likewise the third direction, likewise the
fourth direction, above, below, around, to all beings in the entire world he
dwells pervading with a mind imbued with compassion, abundant, grown great,
boundless, and free from enmity and ill-will.


<p><span class="parno">49</span>
With a mind imbued with mudita, he dwells pervading one direction, likewise
the second direction, likewise the third direction, likewise the fourth
direction, above, below, around, to all beings in the entire world he dwells
pervading with a mind imbued with mudita, abundant, grown great, boundless,
and free from enmity and ill-will.

<p><span class="parno">50</span>
With a mind imbued with equanimity, he dwells pervading one direction,
likewise the second direction, likewise the third direction, likewise the
fourth direction, above, below, around, to all beings in the entire world he
dwells pervading with a mind imbued with equanimity, abundant, grown great,

<p><span class="parno">51</span>
That noble disciple, O Kalamas, with a mind thus free from enmity, a mind
thus free from ill-will, a mind thus undefiled, a mind thus purified, has
gained four consolations in this very life.

<p><span class="parno">52</span>
“If there is another world, if there are fruits and results of kamma, of
what is well done and badly done, it is the case that with the breakup of
the body, after death, I will arise in a happy destination, a heavenly
world.” This is the first consolation he has gained.

<p><span class="parno">53</span>
“But if there is no other world, if there are no fruits and results of
kamma, of what is well done and badly done, then here in this very life, I
maintain myself free from enmity, free from affliction, untroubled and
happy.” This is the second consolation he has gained.

<p><span class="parno">54</span>
“But if evil befalls the doer [of evil], then I do not intend any
evil. [Since] there is non-doing of evil kamma by me, from where will
suffering touch me?” This is the third consolation he has gained.

<p><span class="parno">55</span>
“But if evil does not befall the doer [of evil], then here I certainly
see myself purified in both respects.” This is the fourth
consolation he has gained.

<p><span class="parno">56</span>
“That noble disciple, O Kalamas, with a mind thus free from enmity, a
mind thus free from ill-will, a mind thus undefiled, a mind thus purified,
has gained these four consolations in this very life.”

<p><span class="parno">57</span>
“That is so, O Auspicious One, that is so, O Well-farer. That noble
disciple, O Bhante, with a mind thus free from enmity, a mind thus free from
ill-will, a mind thus undefiled, a mind thus purified, has gained four
consolations in this very life.

<p><span class="parno">58</span>

<p><span class="parno">63</span>
“Excellent, O Bhante! Excellent, O Bhante! Just as, O Bhante, one might
set upright what has been overturned, or open up what has been closed, or
show a path to one who is lost, or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so that
those with good eyesight can see forms, just so has the Dhamma been
explained by the venerable Gotama in countless ways. We go, O Bhante, to the
Auspicious Gotama, as refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of
bhikkhus. May Master Gotama bear it in mind, that we are lay disciples who
have gone for refuge from today for as long as life lasts.”
