Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling at
Rajagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then, Sajjha the wonderer visited with the
Auspicious One. Upon arrival, he exchanged friendly greetings with the
Auspicious One. Having exchange greetings of friendliness and courtesy, he
sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, Sajjha the wonderer said
this to the Auspicious One:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
On this one occasion, O Bhante, the Auspicious One was dwelling right here
at Rajagaha, the Mountain Fort. There, O Bhante, this was learned by me in
the presence of the Auspicious One. “The bhikkhu, O Sajjha, who is an
arahant, one with asavas destroyed, who has lived [the life of purity], done
what must be done, laid down the burden, attained the true advantage,
completely destroyed the fetters of being, one who is liberated by right
final knowledge, is unable to transgress by five means.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to purposely deprive a
living being of life. The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to take
what is not given, [that which] is reckoned as theft. The bhikkhu with
asavas destroyed is unable to engage in sexual intercourse. The bhikkhu with
asavas destroyed is unable to speak a deliberate lie. The bhikkhu with
asavas destroyed is unable to store up things to use for enjoyment, as he
did formerly while being a householder.” I hope, O Bhante, this was
heard well by me from the Auspicious One, well learned, well attended to,
well remembered.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Certainly, O Sajjha, this was heard well by you, well learned, well attended
to, well remembered. Formerly, as well as now, O Sajjha, I say thus: “The
bhikkhu, O Sajjha, who is an arahant, one with asavas destroyed, who has
lived [the life of purity], done what must be done, laid down the burden,
attained the true advantage, completely destroyed the fetters of being, one
who is liberated by right final knowledge, is unable to transgress by nine
means: The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to purposely deprive a
living being of life. The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to take
what is not given, [that which] is reckoned as theft. The bhikkhu with
asavas destroyed is unable to engage in sexual intercourse. The bhikkhu with
asavas destroyed is unable to speak a deliberate lie. The bhikkhu with
asavas destroyed is unable to store up things to use for enjoyment, as he
did formerly while being a householder.”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to go under the influence of
desire. The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to go under the
influence of hatred. The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to go under
the influence of delusion. The bhikkhu with asavas destroyed is unable to go
under the influence of fear. Formerly, as well as now, O Sajjha, I say thus:
“The bhikkhu, O Sajjha, who is an arahant, one with asavas destroyed, who
has lived [the life of purity], done what must be done, laid down the
burden, attained the true advantage, completely destroyed the fetters of
being, one who is liberated by right final knowledge, is unable to
transgress by these nine means.”
