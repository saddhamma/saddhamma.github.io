At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling in Sāvatthi at Jeta's Grove,
Anathapindika's Park. It so happened that in the morning, the venerable
Ananda, having dressed, having taken bowl and robe, by which [way led to]
the female lay disciple, Migasala's house, by that way he approached. Having
approached, he sat down on a prepared seat. Then, by which [way led to] the
venerable Ananda, by that way the female lay disciple, Migasala
approached. Having approached the venerable Ananda, having bowed down, she
sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the female lay disciple,
Migasala said this to the venerable Ananda:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Bhante Ananda, indeed how — oh, how — is this Dhamma taught by the
Auspicious One to be understood, in as much as one who is celibate and one
who is not celibate will both have the very same destination in their
after-death state? Bhante, my father, Purana, who was celibate, living
withdrawn, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the villager's conduct. He
passed away [and] the Auspicious One declared [him to be] “a sakadagami,
who has re-arosen as a [celestial] being in the Tusita group.”
Bhante, my father's brother, Isidatta, who was not celibate but lived
happily with his own wife, also passed away. The Auspicious One declared
[him to be] “a sakadagami, who has re-arisen as a [celestial] being in
the Tusita group.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“Bhante Ananda, indeed how — oh, how — is this Dhamma taught by the
Auspicious One to be understood, in as much as one who is celibate and one
who is not celibate will both have the very same destination in their
after-death state?” “Yes, sister. The Auspicious One did declare
this.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
So then, the venerable Ananda, having taken almsfood at the female lay
disciple, Migasāla's house, having risen from his seat, departed. Then after
the meal, the venerable Ananda, having gone back after alms gathering, by
which [way led to] the Auspicious One, by that way he approached. Having
approached the Auspicious One, having bowed down, he sat down to one
side. Having sat down to one side, the venerable Ananda said this to the
Auspicious One:

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Here Bhante, in the morning, having dressed, having taken bowl and robe, by
which [way led to] the female lay disciple, Migasala's house, by that way I
approached. Having approached, I sat down on a prepared seat. Then, by which
[way led to] me, by that way the female lay disciple, Migasala
approached. Having approached me, having bowed down, she sat down to one
side. Having sat down to one side, the female lay disciple, Migasala said
this to me:

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Bhante Ananda, indeed how — oh, how — is this Dhamma taught by the
Auspicious One to be understood, in as much as one who is celibate and one
who is not celibate will both have the very same destination in their
after-death state? Bhante, my father, Purana, who was celibate, living
withdrawn, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the villager's conduct. He
passed away [and] the Auspicious One declared [him to be] “a sakadagami,
who has re-arisen as a [celestial] being in the Tusita group.”
Bhante, my father's brother Isidatta, who was not celibate but lived happily
with his own wife, also passed away. The Auspicious One declared [him to be]
“a sakadagami, who is re-arisen as a [celestial] being in the Tusita
group.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
“Bhante Ananda, indeed how — oh, how — is this Dhamma taught by the
Auspicious One to be understood, in as much as one who is celibate and one
who is not celibate will both have the very same destination in their
after-death state?” When thus was said, Bhante, I said this to the
female lay disciple, Migasāla: “Yes, sister. The Auspicious One did
declare this.”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
But who, Ananda, is the female lay disciple, Migasala, a foolish, unlearned
woman with a woman's wisdom. And who have knowledge of persons or
individuals pertaining to this world and the world beyond?

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
These ten individuals, O Ananda, are to be found existing in the
world. Which ten?

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
1. Here Ananda, a certain individual is immoral but he does not wisely
understand as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind,
liberation by wisdom, where that immorality of his ceases without
remainder. He has not done that by which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to
be; he has also not done that by which great learning of [the Dhamma] comes
to be. He has not penetrated [the Dhamma] by view. He does not gain
temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is
headed for deterioration not for distinction, he is one who simply goes to
deterioration, not one who goes to distinction.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
2. Here Ananda, a certain individual is immoral and he wisely understands as
it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind, liberation by wisdom,
where that immorality of his ceases without remainder. He has done that by
which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to be; he has also done that by which
great learning of [the Dhamma] comes to be. He has penetrated [the Dhamma]
by view. He gains temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after
death, he is headed for distinction not for deterioration, he is one who
simply goes to distinction, not one who goes to deterioration.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
Therein Ananda, those who are judgmental, judging [thus]: “This one is of
just that nature, the other one too is of just that nature. From what is one
of those inferior and one superior?” That [judging] indeed, O
Ananda, comes to be for the harm and suffering of those for a long time.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
“Therein Ananda, whichever individual is immoral and wisely understands
as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind, liberation by wisdom
where that immorality of his ceases without remainder; who has done that by
which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to be; who has also done that by which
great learning of [the Dhamma] comes to be, who has penetrated [the Dhamma]
by view; who gains temporary liberation; this individual, O Ananda, is more
brilliant and more excellent than the former individual. What is the reason
of that? This is because, O Ananda, the stream of Dhamma carries along that
individual.” Who could understand that difference except for the
Tathagata. Therefore, Ananda, let you not be [one of] those who are
judgmental on individuals, do not you hold judgments on
individuals. Individuals, O Ananda, holding judgment on others harm
[themselves]. But I, Ananda, or else someone like me, may hold judgment on
individuals.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
3. Yet, here Ananda, a certain individual is virtuous but he does not wisely
understand as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind,
liberation by wisdom, where that virtue of his ceases without remainder. He
has not done that by which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to be; he has also
not done that by which great learning of [the Dhamma] comes to be. He has
not penetrated [the Dhamma] by view. He does not gain temporary
liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is headed for
deterioration not for distinction, he is one who simply goes to
deterioration, not one who goes to distinction.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
4. Yet, here Ananda, a certain individual is virtuous and he wisely
understands as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind,
liberation by wisdom, where that virtue of his ceases without remainder. He
has done that by which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to be; he has also done
that by which great learning of [the Dhamma] comes to be. He has penetrated
[the Dhamma] by view. He gains temporary liberation. With the breakup of the
body, after death, he is headed for distinction not for deterioration, he is
one who simply goes to distinction, not one who goes to deterioration.

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
Therein Ananda, those who are judgmental, judging [thus]: “This one is of
just that nature, the other one too is of just that nature. From what is one
of those inferior and one superior?” That [judging] indeed, O
Ananda, comes to be for the harm and suffering of those for a long time.

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
“Therein Ananda, whichever individual is virtuous and wisely understands
as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind, liberation by wisdom
where that virtue of his ceases without remainder; who has done that by
which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to be; who has also done that by which
great learning of [the Dhamma] comes to be, who has penetrated [the Dhamma]
by view; who gains temporary liberation; this individual, O Ananda, is more
brilliant and more excellent than the former individual. What is the reason
of that? This is because, O Ananda, the stream of Dhamma carries along that

Tathagata. Therefore, Ananda, let you not be [one of] those who are
judgmental on individuals, do not you hold judgments on
individuals. Individuals, O Ananda, holding judgment on others harm
[themselves]. But I, Ananda, or else someone like me, may hold judgment on
individuals.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
5. Yet, here Ananda, a certain individual has acute lust but he does not
wisely understand as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind,
liberation by wisdom, where that lust of his ceases without remainder. He
has not done that by which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to be; he has also
not done that by which great learning of [the Dhamma] comes to be. He has
not penetrated [the Dhamma] by view. He does not gain temporary
liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is headed for
deterioration not for distinction, he is one who simply goes to
deterioration, not one who goes to distinction.

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
6. Yet here Ananda, a certain individual has acute lust and he wisely
understands as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind,
liberation by wisdom, where that lust of his ceases without remainder. He
has done that by which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to be; he has also done
that by which great learning of [the Dhamma] comes to be. He has penetrated
[the Dhamma] by view. He gains temporary liberation. With the breakup of the
body, after death, he is headed for distinction not for deterioration, he is
one who simply goes to distinction, not one who goes to deterioration.

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
Therein Ananda, those who are judgmental, judging [thus]: “This one is of
just that nature, the other one too is of just that nature. From what is one
of those inferior and one superior?” That [judging] indeed, O
Ananda, comes to be for the harm and suffering of those for a long time.

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
“Therein Ananda, whichever individual has acute lust and wisely
understands as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind,
liberation by wisdom where that lust of his ceases without remainder; who
has done that by which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to be; who has also
done that by which great learning of [the Dhamma] comes to be, who has
penetrated [the Dhamma] by view; who gains temporary liberation; this
individual, O Ananda, is more brilliant and more excellent than the former
individual. What is the reason of that? This is because, O Ananda, the
stream of Dhamma carries along that individual.” Who could
understand that difference except for the Tathagata. Therefore, Ananda, let
you not be [one of] those who are judgmental on individuals, do not you hold
judgments on individuals. Individuals, O Ananda, holding judgment on others
harm [themselves]. But I, Ananda, or else someone like me, may hold judgment
on individuals.

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
7. Yet, here Ananda, a certain individual is prone to anger but he does not
wisely understand as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind,
liberation by wisdom, where that anger of his ceases without remainder. He
has not done that by which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to be; he has also
not done that by which great learning of [the Dhamma] comes to be. He has
not penetrated [the Dhamma] by view. He does not gain temporary
liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is headed for
deterioration not for distinction, he is one who simply goes to
deterioration, not one who goes to distinction.

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
8. Yet here Ananda, a certain individual is prone to anger and he wisely
understands as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind,
liberation by wisdom, where that anger of his ceases without remainder. He
has done that by which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to be; he has also done
that by which great learning of [the Dhamma] comes to be. He has penetrated
[the Dhamma] by view. He gains temporary liberation. With the breakup of the
body, after death, he is headed for distinction not for deterioration, he is
one who simply goes to distinction, not one who goes to deterioration.

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
Therein Ananda, those who are judgmental, judging [thus]: “This one is of
just that nature, the other one too is of just that nature. From what is one
of those inferior and one superior?” That [judging] indeed, O
Ananda, comes to be for the harm and suffering of those for a long time.

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
“Therein Ananda, whichever individual is prone to anger and wisely
understands as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind,
liberation by wisdom where that anger of his ceases without remainder; who
has done that by which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to be; who has also
done that by which great learning of [the Dhamma] comes to be, who has
penetrated [the Dhamma] by view; who gains temporary liberation; this
individual, O Ananda, is more brilliant and more excellent than the former
individual. What is the reason of that? This is because, O Ananda, the
stream of Dhamma carries along that individual.” Who could

you not be [one of] those who are judgmental on individuals, do not you hold
judgments on individuals. Individuals, O Ananda, holding judgment on others
harm [themselves]. But I, Ananda, or else someone like me, may hold judgment
on individuals.

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
9. Yet, here Ananda, a certain individual is restless but he does not wisely
understand as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind,
liberation by wisdom, where that restlessness of his ceases without
remainder. He has not done that by which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to
be; he has also not done that by which great learning of [the Dhamma] comes
to be. He has not penetrated [the Dhamma] by view. He does not gain
temporary liberation. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is
headed for deterioration not for distinction, he is one who simply goes to
deterioration, not one who goes to distinction.

<p><span class="parno">27</span>
10. Yet here Ananda, a certain individual is restless and he wisely
understands as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind,
liberation by wisdom, where that restlessness of his ceases without
remainder. He has done that by which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to be; he
has also done that by which great learning of [the Dhamma] comes to be. He
has penetrated [the Dhamma] by view. He gains temporary liberation. With the
breakup of the body, after death, he is headed for distinction not for
deterioration, he is one who simply goes to distinction, not one who goes to
deterioration.

<p><span class="parno">28</span>
Therein Ananda, those who are judgmental, judging [thus]: “This one is of
just that nature, the other one too is of just that nature. From what is one
of those inferior and one superior?” That [judging] indeed, O
Ananda, comes to be for the harm and suffering of those for a long time.

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
“Therein Ananda, whichever individual is restless but wisely understands
as it has come to be, that liberation by state of mind, liberation by wisdom
where that restlessness of his ceases without remainder; who has done that
by which hearing of [the Dhamma] comes to be; who has also done that by
which great learning of [the Dhamma] comes to be, who has penetrated [the
Dhamma] by view; who gains temporary liberation.

<p><span class="parno">30</span>
This individual, O Ananda, is more brilliant and more excellent than the
former individual. What is the reason of that? This is because, O Ananda,
the stream of Dhamma carries along that individual.” Who could
understand that difference except for the Tathagata. Therefore, Ananda, let
you not be [one of] those who are judgmental on individuals, do not you hold
judgments on individuals. Individuals, O Ananda, holding judgment on others
harm [themselves]. But I, Ananda, or else someone like me, may hold judgment
on individuals.

<p><span class="parno">31</span>
But who, Ananda, is the female lay disciple, Migasala, a foolish, unlearned
woman with a woman's wisdom. And who have knowledge of persons or
individuals pertaining to this world and the world beyond?These ten
individuals, O Ananda, are to be found in the world.

<p><span class="parno">32</span>
“Ananda, if Purana was endowed with that form of virtue Isidatta was
endowed with, Purana would not have known the destiny of Isidatta here. But
Ananda, if Isidatta was endowed with that form of wisdom Purana was endowed
with, Isidatta too would not have known the destiny of Purana here. Thus, O
Ananda, both  these individuals were deficient in one factor.”
