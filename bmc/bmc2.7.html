<h3>Chapter 7: Monastery Buildings and Property</h3>

<p><strong>Monasteries. </strong> One of the earliest allowances in the Buddha&rsquo;s teaching career was for accepting the donation of a monastery. The context of the allowance suggests that the monastery should be donated to the entire Saṅgha, rather than to individual Communities or bhikkhus. This point is supported by the passage from <a href="../dn/dn2.html">DN2</a>, cited in the preceding chapter, which states that a virtuous bhikkhu does not accept fields and property. However, none of the texts discuss this point in detail.</p>

<p>There is an allowance in <a href="../vi/kd6.html">Khandaka 6 (Mv 6)</a> for monastery attendants: lay people whose job is to look after the affairs of the monastery. In feudal and pre-feudal days, these attendants would be given to a monastery by a king or other feudal lord. The origin story to the allowance suggests that in some cases the gift would encompass the inhabitants of an entire village. The tax revenues and corvée labor from the village, instead of going to the secular authorities, would go to the monastery. Again, the Pali Canon and commentaries do not discuss this arrangement in any detail. This is in sharp contrast to the Vinayas of some of the other early schools, such as the Mūlasarvāstivādins, who went to great lengths to prohibit non-Buddhist kings from later rescinding such arrangements. This point argues for the relative lateness of these rules in the other Vinayas: The Buddha was not so foolish as to try to legislate for kings.</p>

<p>The Canon does, however, give a detailed discussion of the buildings allowed in a monastery and of the proper use and distribution of monastic property. In some cases, the distribution of monastic property is handed over to officials chosen by the Community. As this choice involves a Community transaction, all issues related to the responsibilities of Community officials will be discussed in <a href="../bmc/bmc2.18.html">Chapter 18</a>. Here we will discuss monastic buildings and the issues concerning monastic property for which Community officials are not responsible.</p>

<p><strong>Buildings. </strong> In addition to dwellings, the monastery may include an uposatha hall (for the chanting of the Pāṭimokkha), an assembly hall (according to the Commentary, this covers halls for holding meetings or for eating meals), a drinking water hall or pavilion, a fire hall (apparently used for boiling water, dyeing robes, etc.), a storehouse, a food storage place, walking meditation paths, a well, a sauna, a hall or pavilion for the kaṭhina frame, bathing and restroom facilities, and surrounding enclosures. (The <i>hall</i> (<i>sāla</i>) in each of these cases is apparently a roofed building without walls; the <i>pavilion</i> (<i>maṇḍapa</i>) is also an open building, but smaller.) The construction details allowed for these buildings resemble those allowed for dwellings. Anyone interested may check the rules at the end of this chapter. Here we will discuss details peculiar to some of these buildings.</p>

<p><i>Uposatha hall &amp; storehouse.</i> No construction details are given for these buildings. The only rules related to them concern communal transactions, so they will be discussed in <a href="../bmc/bmc2.15.html">Chapters 15</a> and <a href="../bmc/bmc2.18.html">18</a>.</p>

<p><i>Food storage place (kappiya-kuṭi</i>). This is a space designated within the monastic compound where food may be stored and yet not count as &quot;stored indoors&quot; under <a href="../vi/kd6.html">Khandaka 6 (Mv 6)</a>. The Canon allows for the &quot;backmost&quot; building in the monastery to be designated as a food storage place, but the Commentary maintains that the building may be located anywhere in the monastery. The Canon states that such a space should be authorized with a formal transaction statement, but the Commentary says that a simple declaration to the assembled bhikkhus is sufficient. The rules concerning this space are confusing. In one passage, the Canon imposes a dukkaṭa for using such a space; and then, in the following passage, gives an allowance to use four kinds of food storage spaces, none of which it defines. Some Communities interpret the prohibition against using a food storage space as a prohibition against a bhikkhu's staying in such a place.</p>

<p>The Canon lists, without explanation, four types of allowable food storage places. Commentary quotes a variety of opinions on their precise definitions, which indicates that no one by that time was absolutely sure of what they were. To summarize its discussion:</p>

<ul> <li><i>Ussāvanantika</i> (&quot;limited to the proclamation&quot; or &quot;conterminous with the proclamation&quot;): According to Buddhaghosa, the ancient Sinhalese commentaries mention several ways for making a storage space of this sort, but he himself recommends this: When starting construction of the storage place, after the foundation has been laid, a group of bhikkhus should gather around and, as the first post is being put in place, say (not in unison),</li> <li><i>&quot;Kappiya-kuṭiṃ karoma</i> (We make this allowable hut).&quot;</li> <li>The statement should end as the post settles in place. If the end of the statement does not coincide with the placing of the post, the statement is invalid. This is why the Mahā Paccarī recommends that several bhikkhus say this not in unison, so that the placing of the post will occur at the end of the statement made by at least one of them. If, instead of setting up a post, the walls of the storage place are built out of stone or brick, the same thing should be done when the first stone/brick is placed on the foundation.</li> <li><i>Gonisādikā</i> (&quot;where cattle can rest&quot;): This is an unenclosed or semi-enclosed space that may be built only in an unenclosed monastery. If none of the bhikkhus' residences are enclosed, the storage space is called an ārāma-gonisādikā. If the monastery as a whole is not enclosed but some of the residences are, it's called a vihāra-gonisādikā. In either case, the important factor is that the monastery not be enclosed. (The image here is that if a place is unenclosed, cattle can enter and rest at their leisure.)</li> <li><i>Gahapatika</i> (set up by or belonging to a lay person): This sort of space is built and donated by the donors specifically to be used as a proper storage place. Buddhaghosa quotes approvingly from the Andhaka, saying that the dwelling of anyone aside from a member of a Bhikkhu Saṅgha counts as a gahapatika. Thus a novice's dwelling would come under this category, as would a lay person's dwelling in or outside a monastery.</li> <li><i>Sammatikā</i> (authorized): Any of the five allowable types of lodging (Cv.VI.1.2) authorized by a communal transaction (see Appendix I). The Commentary says that a simple announcement to the assembled bhikkhus is sufficient to authorize such a space, but this conflicts with the principle in Mv.IX.3.3 that if a shorter format is used for a transaction requiring a longer format, the transaction is invalid.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The rules concerning this last type of space are confusing. In one passage, the Canon imposes a dukkaṭa for using one; and then, in the following passage, allows its use. Some Communities interpret the first passage as a prohibition against a bhikkhu's staying in such a place, and the second as an allowance to store food there.</li> <li>Of the four types, the ussāvanantika loses its status when all the posts or all the walls are taken down. The gonisādikā becomes an improper storage place when it is enclosed. If, however, the enclosure begins to fall down to the point where a cow could enter it, the status of proper storage place returns. As for the remaining two types, they lose their status as proper storage places when all the roofing is destroyed.</li> </ul>
<p><i>Walking meditation paths</i> may be made either by leveling the ground or by building a path on a foundation of brick, stone, or wood. In the latter case, a stairway may be built up to the path, with a railing allowed both for the stairway and surrounding the path. The path may be roofed, the roof may be plastered and decorated with the four allowable designs, and there may be a cord or a pole for hanging up one's robes.</p>

<p><i>Wells</i> may be lined with bricks, stones, or wood, and covered with a roofed hall. Other allowable well equipment includes a rope for drawing water, a well-sweep (a long stick on a pivot with a counter-weight at one end, to help pull a water bucket up from the well), a pulley, a water-wheel, three kinds of buckets — made of metal, wood, or strips of hide — a lid for the well, and a trough or pot/basin for keeping water.</p>

<p><i>Saunas.</i> In addition to the usual construction details, saunas may be faced (as in <a href="../bmc/bmc1.8-2.html#pc19">Pācittiya 19</a>) and may be built with a projecting gable (on all sides, says the Sub-commentary). A fireplace is to be built to one side in a small sauna, and in the middle of a large one. It may be provided with a chimney. One may smear one's face with clay as protection against being scorched by the fire; if the clay smells foul, one is allowed to cure it (with perfumed substances, says the Commentary). To protect one's body from being scorched, one may bring in water. A tank is allowed for storing it, and a dipper is allowed as well. To keep the floor from getting muddy, the sauna may be floored with bricks, stones, or wood. There is also an allowance for washing the floor and providing a water drain. In response to an incident where bhikkhus sitting on the floor of the sauna found their limbs growing numb, there is an allowance for using a chair in the sauna.</p>

<p><i>Bathing facilities.</i> Separate places for showering and bathing are allowed. The showering place (<i>udaka-candanika</i>) may be enclosed and floored with any of three kinds of material — brick, stone, or wood — and provided with a water drain. A bathing tank may be lined with any of the same sorts of materials and, if necessary, built up high off the ground.</p>

<p><i>Restroom facilities.</i> Separate places are allowed for urinating, defecating, and rinsing oneself with water after defecating. The urinal in use at the Buddha&rsquo;s time consisted of a pot with footrests on either side. The restroom (outhouse) for defecating was built over a cesspool lined with brick, stones, or wood. The cesspool had a cover with a hole in the middle and footrests on either side. (The cover was allowed after bhikkhus &quot;defecating as they sat on the edge (of the cesspool) fell in.&quot;) In both cases, the Commentary says, the footrests could be made of brick/tile, stone, or wood. A lid was allowed for the cesspool opening, as was a urine trough. The construction details allowed for the restroom built over the cesspool are similar to those for a dwelling. A sling was also allowed so that old or sick bhikkhus could pull themselves up from the squatting position after defecating. Wood sticks were used for wiping — a receptacle was allowed for placing used sticks — and the job was finished by rinsing with water. A separate place was set aside for rinsing, with its own lidded water pot, ladle, and footrests. Further details concerning the etiquette in using the restroom facilities may be found in <a href="../bmc/bmc2.9.html">Chapter 9</a>.</p>

<p><i>Enclosures.</i> Three kinds of enclosures are allowed. Because there is a separate allowance for fences around dwellings, this list is apparently meant for the enclosures around the monastery as a whole: a hedge of bamboo, a hedge of thorns, and a moat. None of the texts explain why the three materials allowed for fences around a dwelling — bricks, stones, or wood — are not mentioned here as well. Two possible explanations come to mind: Perhaps bricks, stones, and wood were considered too expensive in the time of the Buddha for such a large enclosure; or perhaps the allowance for fences was meant to apply here as well. Since the medieval period, Communities have apparently assumed the second explanation, as there is evidence for brick enclosures around monastic ruins dating from that time, and brick and concrete block enclosures are still common around monasteries in Theravāda countries today.</p>

<p>The enclosure may have a roofed gatehouse, and the entrance may be provided with a gate of thorns and brambles, a double door, an archway, and a bar connected to a pulley. To keep the area within the enclosure from getting muddy, it may be strewn with gravel, laid with flagstones, and provided with a water drain.</p>

<p><strong>Monastery property. </strong> If the Community is given fancy items of value — examples mentioned in the Canon include costly woolen blankets and costly woven cloths — they may be traded &quot;for something profitable.&quot; This, the Commentary says, means that they may be traded for objects of equal or higher value. If the Community receives bear hide, rags, and similar items that cannot be made into robes, they may be made into foot-wiping mats. (The allowance for bear hide here is unusual; it is apparently the only hide that can be used in this way, and there is no telling why.) Cloth that can be made into robes, when given to the Community, falls under the aegis of the Community official responsible for accepting, keeping, and distributing cloth (see <a href="../bmc/bmc2.18.html">Chapter 18</a>).</p>

<p>Furnishings given for use in a particular dwelling are not to be moved elsewhere. However, they may be borrowed temporarily and also moved &quot;to protect them&quot; (e.g., if the roof of the dwelling in which they are located starts to leak). The Commentary adds here that if, when taking them to protect them, one uses them as Community property and they wear out with normal use, there is no need to make reimbursement. When the original dwelling is repaired and able to protect furnishings, one should return them if they are in shape to return. If one has used them as one's own personal property and they wear out, one must reimburse the Community. The Commentary's notion of reimbursement, however, comes under the idea of <i>bhaṇḍhadeyya</i>, which — as we saw under <a href="../bmc/bmc1.4.html#pr2">Pārājika 2</a> — has no basis in the Canon.</p>

<p>This arrangement — of giving furniture and other &quot;lodging&quot; items specifically for use in a particular dwelling — is the closest reference in the Canon to an arrangement that looms large in the Commentary and in the Vinayas of the other early schools: a dwelling given by a donor who continues to take a proprietary interest in the dwelling, its furnishings, and its inhabitants. This practice may have grown out of the arrangement mentioned in <a href="../bmc/bmc1.5.html#sg7">Sanghādisesa 7</a>, in which a donor sponsors the construction of a dwelling, but aside from the above rule the Canon does not recognize it.</p>

<p>Apparently, one of the possible duties for monastery attendants was to farm for the monastery. Thus there is a ruling in the Canon that when seed of the Community has been planted in the land of an individual, or if the seed of an individual has been planted in the land of the Community, it may be consumed by the bhikkhus after having given the individual a portion.</p>

<p>The Canon lists five classes of Community belongings that cannot be given out to any individual or divided up among the bhikkhus, even by a Community transaction or through the agency of a Community official. Any bhikkhu who does give out or divide up these belongings incurs a thullaccaya — and even then the belongings do not count as given out or divided up. They are still the property of the Community. The five classes are:</p>

<ul> <li>1) A monastery, the site of/for a monastery.</li> <li>2) A dwelling, the site of/for a dwelling.</li> <li>3) A bed, bench, mattress, pillow.</li> <li>4) A metal pot, a metal basin, a metal jar/bottle, a metal vessel/frying pan (wok), a knife/machete, an axe, an adze, a hoe, a drill/chisel.</li> <li>5) Vines, bamboo, coarse grass, reeds, tiṇa-grass, clay (all of these can be used as building materials), wooden goods, clay goods.</li> </ul>
<p>The Commentary has a fair amount to say about these items. The <i>site of a monastery</i> it interprets as land intended for a monastery or the site of an abandoned monastery; it gives a similar definition for the <i>site of a dwelling.</i> Under the fourth category, it says that <i>knife</i> means large knives (such as machetes) and large shears; <i>chisel/drill</i> means those with handles, while other metal tools of carpenters, lathe-workers, jewelers, and leather-workers would also come under this sub-category. However, small metal vessels of the sort designed to be carried on one's person are all right to distribute.</p>

<p>Under the fifth category, it interprets <i>vines</i> as those at least a half-arm's length. Vines, grass, and reeds that have already been used and are left over from construction work are all right to distribute. The word <i>bamboo</i> is meant to cover bamboo to be used for construction. Small bamboo items such as canes, small oil containers, or umbrella parts are all right to distribute. Buddhaghosa reports a disagreement between the Kurundī and the Mahā Aṭṭhakathā on what is included under <i>wooden goods</i> here. According to the Kurundī, this sub-category includes all leather goods and any wooden goods larger than an 8&quot; needle. According to the Mahā Aṭṭhakathā, it includes all furniture and wooden articles (although furniture would seem to come under category (3)), with the exception of a water flask — whether made of real wood, bamboo, goat leather, or leaves. Allowable leather goods (such as sandals) are not included here. Also not included are: unfinished furniture parts, canes/staffs, shoes, fire-generating sticks, filters, water jugs/flasks, small horn flasks, ointment boxes, and buttons. As for <i>clay goods,</i> the Commentary says that this sub-category covers dishes, pottery, bricks, tiles, chimney tiles, and water or drain pipes. Alms bowls and small clay vessels of the sort designed to be carried on one's person are not included here, and so are all right to distribute.</p>

<p>Reasoning from the Great Standards, we can say that all construction materials donated to the Community would come under category (5).</p>

<p>For purposes of generalization, the Commentary divides these five categories into two major classes:</p>

<ul> <li><i>thāvara-vatthu</i> (permanent items), categories (1) and (2); and</li> <li><i>garubhaṇḍa</i> (heavy or expensive goods), categories (3), (4), and (5).</li> </ul>
<p>Although none of the items in either of these two classes may be given away, they may be exchanged for other items in the same class. Thus, a dwelling may be exchanged for the site of a monastery. Taking a loss in the trade is permissible if a good reason justifies it (although this would seem to contradict the Commentary's own interpretation of Cv.VI.19). If the trade will turn a profit for the Community, the bhikkhus making the trade must point this out to the other side. If the other side still wants to go ahead with the trade, fine and good. It is also permissible to trade one expensive item for a larger number of inexpensive items in the same class; and to trade items inappropriate for the bhikkhus' use — such as goods made of gold, silver, gold alloys, or crystal — for appropriate items.</p>

<p>The Sub-commentary gives permission to exchange garubhaṇḍa for thāvara-vatthu.</p>

<p>The Commentary adds that during a famine, the bhikkhus in a monastery may sell off garubhaṇḍa for food, so that enough bhikkhus will be able to stay there to look after the remaining property, but there is nothing in the Canon to support this.</p>

<p><strong>Cetiya property. </strong> The Commentary to <a href="../bmc/bmc1.4.html#pr2">Pārājika 2</a> makes a clear distinction between belongings of the Community and belongings given to a cetiya. Under no circumstances should items given to a cetiya — this includes stūpas and Buddha images — be treated as Community property.</p>
