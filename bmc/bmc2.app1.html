<h3>E. Kaṭhina</h3> <h4>Optional preliminary statements:</h4>
<p>Offering the cloth</p>

<p>Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammā-sambuddhassa (three times).</p>

<p>Imaṃ bhante sapparivāraṃ kaṭhina-dussaṃ saṅghassa oṇojayāma. Sādhu no bhante saṅgho, imaṃ sapparivāraṃ kaṭhina-dussaṃ paṭiggaṇhātu, paṭiggahetvā ca iminā dussena kaṭhinaṃ attharatu, amhākaṃ dīgha-rattaṃ hitāya sukhāya.</p>

<p><i>Homage to the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the Rightly Self-awakened One.</i></p>

<p><i>Venerable sirs, we present this kaṭhina-cloth, together with its accessories, to the Community. It would be good if the Community would accept this kaṭhina-cloth together with its accessories, and having accepted it, would spread the kaṭhina with it, for our long-term welfare and happiness.</i></p>

<h4>Formal consultation</h4>
<p>First bhikkhu:</p>

<p>Idāni kho bhante idaṃ sapparivāraṃ kaṭhina-dussaṃ saṅghassa kaṭhinatthārāraha-kāleyeva uppannaṃ. īdise ca kāle evaṃ uppannena dussena kaṭhinatthāro vassaṃ vutthānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ bhagavatā anuññāto. Yena ākaṅkhamānassa saṅghassa pañca kappissanti: anāmantacāro, asamādānacāro, gaṇa-bhojanaṃ, yāva-d-attha-cīvaraṃ, yo ca tattha cīvaruppādo so nesaṃ bhavissati. Catūsupi hemantikesu māsesu cīvara-kālo mahantī-kato bhavissati. Idāni pana saṅgho ākaṅkhati nu kho kaṭhinatthāraṃ, udāhu nākaṅkhati.</p>

<p><i>Venerable sirs, this kaṭhina-cloth, together with its accessories, has arisen for the Community in the season appropriate for spreading the kaṭhina. And in a season like this the spreading of the kaṭhina has been allowed by the Blessed One for bhikkhus who have completed the Rains-residence. By this means, five things are proper for a Community that desires them: going without taking leave, going without one's complete set of robes, a group meal, keeping robe-cloth as long as is wanted, and any robe-cloth arising there (in the residence where they spent the Rains) will be theirs. Also, the robe-season will be extended throughout the four months of the cold season. Now, does the Community want the spreading of the kaṭhina, or not?</i></p>

<p><strong>The bhikkhus respond:</strong> Ākaṅkhāma, bhante.</p>

<p>(<i>We want it, venerable sir.</i>)</p>

<p>Second bhikkhu:</p>

<p>So kho pana bhante kaṭhinatthāro bhagavatā puggalassa atthāra-vasen'eva anuññāto. Nāññatra puggalassa atthārā atthataṃ hoti kaṭhinanti hi vuttaṃ bhagavatā. Na saṅgho vā gaṇo vā kaṭhinaṃ attharati. Saṅghassa ca gaṇassa ca sāmaggiyā puggalass'eva atthārā, saṅghassapi gaṇassapi tasseva puggalassapi atthataṃ hoti kaṭhinaṃ. Idāni kass'imaṃ kaṭhina-dussaṃ dassāma kaṭhinaṃ attharituṃ. Yo jiṇṇa-cīvaro vā dubbala-cīvaro vā, yo vā pana ussahissati ajj'eva cīvara-kammaṃ niṭṭhāpetvā, sabba-vidhānaṃ aparihāpetvā kaṭhinaṃ attharituṃ samattho bhavissati.</p>

<p><i>Venerable sirs, the Blessed One has allowed the spreading of the kaṭhina only by an individual, for he said, 'Not otherwise than through the spreading by an individual is the kaṭhina spread.' Neither a Community nor a group spreads the kaṭhina. Through the concord of the Community and the group, and through the spreading by the individual is the kaṭhina of the Community, the group, and the individual spread. Now, to whom do we give the kaṭhina-cloth to spread the kaṭhina? To whoever has an old robe or a threadbare robe, or to whoever will strive and — finishing the making of the robe today, without omitting any of the procedures — is capable of spreading the kaṭhina.</i></p>

<p><strong>The bhikkhus remain silent. </strong></p>

<p>Third bhikkhu:</p>

<p>Idha amhesu āyasmā Itthannāmo sabba-mahallako bahussuto dhamma-dharo vinaya-dharo, sabrahmacārīnaṃ sandassako samādapako samuttejako sampahaṃsako, bahunnaṃ ācariyo [vā upajjhāyo vā] hutvā, ovādako anusāsako, samattho ca taṃ taṃ vinaya-kammaṃ avikopetvā kaṭhinaṃ attharituṃ. Maññām'aham-evaṃ &quot;Sabbo'yaṃ saṅgho imaṃ sapparivāraṃ kaṭhina-dussaṃ āyasmato Itthannāmassa dātu-kāmo, tasmiṃ kaṭhinaṃ attharante sabbo'yaṃ saṅgho sammadeva anumodissati.&quot; Āyasmato Itthannāmasseva imaṃ sapparivāraṃ kaṭhina-dussaṃ dātuṃ, ruccati vā no vā sabbass'imassa saṅghassa.</p>

<p><i>Of us here, Venerable (name) is the senior. He is learned, one who remembers the Dhamma, who remembers the Vinaya, one who instructs, urges, rouses, and encourages his fellows in the holy life. Being the teacher [or preceptor] of many, he is one who teaches and expounds (to them). He is also capable of spreading the kaṭhina without spoiling any of the disciplinary requirements. I think that this entire Community wants to give this kaṭhina-cloth, together with its accessories, to Venerable (name), and that when the kaṭhina is spread, this entire Community will rightly give its approval. Is it pleasing to the Community to give the kaṭhina-cloth, together with its accessories, to Venerable (name), or is it not? </i></p>

<p><strong>The bhikkhus respond:</strong> Ruccati, bhante.</p>

<p>(<i>It is pleasing, venerable sir.</i>)</p>

<p>Fourth bhikkhu:</p>

<p>Yadi āyasmato Itthannāmassa imaṃ sapparivāraṃ kaṭhina-dussaṃ dātuṃ, sabbass'imassa saṅghassa ruccati, sādhu bhante saṅgho imaṃ kaṭhina-dussa-parivāra-bhūtaṃ ti-cīvaraṃ vassāvāsikaṭṭhitikāya agāhetvā, āyasmato Itthannāmass'eva iminā apalokanena dadātu. Kaṭhina-dussaṃ pana apalokanena diyyamānam-pi na rūhati. Tasmā &quot;Taṃ idāni ñatti-dutiyena kammena akuppena ṭhānārahena āyasmato Itthannāmassa demāti&quot; kamma-sanniṭṭhānaṃ karotu.</p>

<p><i>If the giving of this kaṭhina-cloth, together with its accessories, to Venerable (name) is pleasing to this entire Community, it would (also) be good to give this set of three robes, which has come into being as part of the accessories of the kaṭhina cloth, without regard to the order for receiving Rains-retreat cloth. As for the kaṭhina-cloth, even if it were given by announcement it would not be effective. So may (the Community) make this transaction-resolution: 'We now give it to Venerable (name) by means of a motion and seconding announcement that is irreversible and fit to stand.'</i></p>

<p><strong>The bhikkhus respond:</strong> Sādhu, bhante.</p>

<p>(<i>Very good, venerable sir.</i>)</p>

<h4>Transaction statement: (<a href="../vi/kd7.html">Khandaka 7 (Mv. 7)</a>)</h4>
<p>(<i>Because the kaṭhina-cloth is usually given to a senior bhikkhu, the form for addressing a senior bhikkhu is given here.</i>)</p>

<p>Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho. Idaṃ saṅghassa kaṭhina-dussaṃ uppannaṃ. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho imaṃ kaṭhina-dussaṃ āyasmato Itthannāmassa dadeyya, kaṭhinaṃ attharituṃ. Esā ñatti.</p>

<p><i>This kaṭhina-cloth is given by the Community to Venerable (name) to spread the kaṭhina. This is agreeable to the Community, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it.</i></p>

<h4>Removing kaṭhina privileges: (Bhī Pācittiya 30)</h4>

<p>Ubbhataṃ saṅghena kaṭhinaṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī. Evam-etaṃ dhārayāmi.</p>

<p><i>Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. If the Community is ready, it should dismantle the kaṭhina (rescind the kaṭhina privileges). This is the motion.</i></p>

<p><i>Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. The Community is dismantling the kaṭhina. He to whom the dismantling of the kaṭhina is agreeable should remain silent. He to whom it is not agreeable should speak.</i></p>

<p><i>The kaṭhina has been dismantled by the Community. This is agreeable to the Community, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it.</i></p>

<h3>G. Complete Motions For Shortened Community Invitations</h3> <h4>When many lay people have been bringing gifts: (Mv.IV.15.3)</h4>
<p>Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho. Manussehi dānaṃ dentehi yebhuyyena ratti khepitā. Sace saṅgho te-vācikaṃ pavāressati, appavārito va saṅgho bhavissati athāyaṃ ratti vibhāyissati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho dve-vācikaṃ [eka-vācikaṃ] {samāna-vassikaṃ} pavāreyya.</p>

<p><i>Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. The night is almost spent with people giving gifts. If the Community invites with the threefold statement, the Community will not be (fully) invited by the time the night is over. If the Community is ready, it should invite with two statements [with one statement] {in the manner of equal Rains}.</i></p>

<h4>When the bhikkhus have been engaged in many activities: (Mv.IV.15.4)</h4>
<p><i>Follow the above pattern, changing <strong>&quot;</strong></i>Manussehi dānaṃ dentehi,&quot; with &quot;Bhikkhūhi kalahaṃ karontehi,&quot; <i>which means, &quot;with the bhikkhus making an uproar.&quot;</i></p>

<h4>When rains threatens, and there is not enough shelter for the bhikkhus: (Mv.IV.15.6)</h4>
<p>Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho. Ayaṃ mahā-bhikkhu-saṅgho sannipatito, parittañca anovassikaṃ, mahā ca megho uggato.

<p><i>Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. This large Community of bhikkhus has met, but the shelter is small, and a large cloud has risen up. If the Community invites with the threefold statement, the Community will not be (fully) invited by the time the cloud rains. If the Community is ready, it should invite with two statements [with one statement] {in the manner of equal Rains}.</i></p>

<h4>When there are obstructions: (Mv.IV.15.7)</h4>
<p>Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho. Ayaṃ rājantarāyo. Sace saṅgho te-vācikaṃ pavāressati, appavārito va saṅgho bhavissati athāyaṃ rājantarāyo bhavissati. Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho dve-vācikaṃ [eka-vācikaṃ] {samāna-vassikaṃ} pavāreyya.</p>

<p><i>Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. This is a king obstruction. If the Community invites with the threefold statement, the Community will not be (fully) invited when the king obstruction comes. If the Community is ready, it should invite with two statements [with one statement] {in the manner of equal Rains}.</i></p>

<p><i>An insanity authorization has been given by the Community to Bhikkhu (name), who is insane, so that whether he remembers the Uposatha or not, whether he remembers the Community transaction or not, whether he comes to the Uposatha or not, whether he comes to the Community transaction or not, the Community will perform the Uposatha, will perform a Community transaction, with (name) or without him. This is agreeable to the Community, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it.</i></p>
