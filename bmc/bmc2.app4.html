<h3>Appendix 4</h3>

<p>The transaction statements the Canon gives for these disciplinary transactions follow closely the details of the origin stories leading up to the first allowance for each transaction. As the Commentary points out, these statements do not fit all the cases where a particular disciplinary transaction can be applied. Thus, it recommends — when imposing one of these transactions on an individual — adjusting the statement to fit the facts of the case, drawing on the list of allowable applications for the transaction as given in the Canon. In the following examples, the portions of the statement that can be adjusted to fit the facts of the case are given in capital letters. Variations that may be substituted for these portions are given after the example.</p>

<h3>A. Censure</h3> <h4>Transaction statement: (Cv.I.1.4)</h4>


<p>Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho. Ayaṃ Itthannāmo bhikkhu <strong><i>bhaṇ_230_ana-kārako hoti, kalaha-kārako vivāda-kārako bhassa-kārako saṅghe adhikaraṇa-kārako.</i></strong> Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno tajjanīya-kammaṃ kareyya. Esā ñatti.</p>

<p>Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho. Ayaṃ Itthannāmo bhikkhu <strong><i>bhaṇ_230_ana-kārako hoti, kalaha-kārako vivāda-kārako bhassa-kārako saṅghe adhikaraṇa-kārako.</i></strong> Saṅgho Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno tajjanīya-kammaṃ karoti. Yass'āyasmato khamati, Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno tajjanīya-kammassa karaṇaṃ, so tuṇh'assa. Yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.</p>

<p>Dutiyam-pi etam-atthaṃ vadāmi. Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho... so bhāseyya.</p>

<p>Tatiyam-pi etam-atthaṃ vadāmi. Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho... so bhāseyya.</p>

<p>Kataṃ saṅghena Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno tajjanīya-kammaṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī. Evam-etaṃ dhārayāmi.</p>

<p><i>Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. This Bhikkhu (name) is a maker of strife, quarrels, disputes, dissension, issues in the Community. If the Community is ready, it should impose a censure transaction on Bhikkhu (name). This is the motion.</i></p>

<p><i>Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. This Bhikkhu (name) is a maker of strife, quarrels, disputes, dissension, issues in the Community. The Community is imposing a censure transaction on Bhikkhu (name). He to whom the imposition of a censure transaction on Bhikkhu (name) is agreeable should remain silent. He to whom it is not agreeable should speak.</i></p>

<p><i>A second time... A third time I speak about this matter. Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me... He to whom it is not agreeable should speak.</i></p>

<p><i>The Community has imposed a censure transaction on Bhikkhu (name). This is agreeable to the Community, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it.</i></p>

<h4>Alternative reasons for imposing censure:</h4>
<p><i>He is inexperienced and incompetent, full of offenses, and has not undergone the penalty for them: </i></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"> <li><strong><i>bālo hoti, abyatto āpatti-bahulo anapadāno</i></strong></li> </ul>
<p><i>He lives in the company of householders, in unbecoming association with householders: </i></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"> <li><strong><i>gihi-saṃsaṭṭho viharati, ananulomikehi gihi-saṃsaggehi</i></strong></li> </ul>
<p><i>With regard to heightened virtue, his virtue is corrupted: </i></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"> <li><strong><i>adhi-sīle sīla-vipanno hoti</i></strong></li> </ul>
<p><i>With regard to heightened behavior, his behavior is corrupted: </i></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"> <li><strong><i>ajjhācāre ācāra-vipanno hoti</i></strong></li> </ul>
<p><i>With regard to higher views, his views are corrupted: </i></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"> <li><strong><i>atidiṭṭhiyā diṭṭhi-vipanno hoti</i></strong></li> </ul>
<p><i>He speaks in dispraise of the Buddha: </i></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"> <li><strong><i>buddhassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati</i></strong></li> </ul>
<p><i>He speaks in dispraise of the Dhamma: </i></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"> <li><strong><i>dhammassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati</i></strong></li> </ul>
<p><i>He speaks in dispraise of the Saṅgha: </i></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"> <li><strong><i>saṅghassa avaṇṇaṃ bhāsati</i></strong></li> </ul> <h3>B. Further Punishment</h3> <h4>Transaction statement: (Cv.IV.11.2)</h4>
<p>Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho. Ayaṃ Itthannāmo bhikkhu <strong><i>saṅgha-majjhe āpattiyā anuyuñjiyamāno avajānitvā paṭijānāti, paṭijānitvā avajānāti, aññena aññaṃ paṭicarati, sampajāna-musā bhāsati.</i></strong> Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno tassa-pāpiyasikā-kammaṃ kareyya. Esā ñatti.</p>

<p>Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho. Ayaṃ Itthannāmo bhikkhu <strong><i>saṅgha-majjhe āpattiyā anuyuñjiyamāno avajānitvā paṭijānāti, paṭijānitvā avajānāti, aññena aññaṃ paṭicarati, sampajāna-musā bhāsati.</i></strong> Saṅgho Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno tassa-pāpiyasikā-kammaṃ karoti. Yass'āyasmato khamati, Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno tassa-pāpiyasikā-kammassa karaṇaṃ, so tuṇh'assa. Yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.</p>

<p>Dutiyam-pi etam-atthaṃ vadāmi. Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho... so bhāseyya.</p>

<p>Tatiyam-pi etam-atthaṃ vadāmi. Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho... so bhāseyya.</p>

<p>Kataṃ saṅghena Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno tassa-pāpiyasikā-kammaṃ. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī. Evam-etaṃ dhārayāmi.</p>

<p><i>Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. This Bhikkhu (name), having been accused of an offense, admits it after denying it, denies it after admitting it, evades the issue, tells a conscious lie. If the Community is ready, it should impose a transaction of further punishment on Bhikkhu (name). This is the motion.</i></p>

<p><i>Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. This Bhikkhu (name), having been accused of an offense, admits it after denying it, denies it after admitting it, evades the issue, tells a conscious lie. The Community is imposing a transaction of further punishment on Bhikkhu (name). He to whom the imposition of a transaction of further punishment on Bhikkhu (name) is agreeable should remain silent. He to whom it is not agreeable should speak.</i></p>

<p><i>A second time... A third time I speak about this matter. Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me... He to whom it is not agreeable should speak.</i></p>

<p><i>The Community has imposed a transaction of further punishment on Bhikkhu (name). This is agreeable to the Community, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it.</i></p>

<p>The above transaction statement follows the example given at Cv.IV.11.2. The basic prerequisite for this transaction, given at Cv.IV.12.1, is that the bhikkhu in question be impure, shameless, and has been accused of having committed an offense (§). In the transaction statement, this would be stated as follows:</p>

<p><i>He is impure, shameless, and accused of having committed an offense:</i></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"> <li><strong><i>Asuci ca hoti alajjī ca sānuvādo ca</i></strong></li> </ul>
<p>However, Cv.IV.12.3 maintains that under this general requirement, all the variations listed under censure would qualify a bhikkhu for this transaction as well. For some reason, BD omits the variations from, &quot;in terms of heightened virtue, his virtue is corrupted,&quot; to, &quot;he speaks in dispraise of the Saṅgha.&quot;</p>

<h3>C. Demotion</h3>
<h4>Transaction statement: (Cv.I.9.2)</h4>
<p>Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho. Ayaṃ Itthannāmo bhikkhu <strong><i>bhaṇ_230_ana-kārako hoti, kalaha-kārako vivāda-kārako bhassa-kārako saṅghe adhikaraṇa- kārako.</i></strong> Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno niyasa-kammaṃ<a id="fnt-1"></a><a href="#fn-1">[1]</a> kareyya, nissāya te vatthabbanti. Esā ñatti.</p>

<p>Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho. Ayaṃ Itthannāmo bhikkhu <strong><i>bhaṇ_230_ana-kārako hoti, kalaha-kārako vivāda-kārako bhassa-kārako saṅghe adhikaraṇa- kārako.</i></strong> Saṅgho Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno niyasa-kammaṃ karoti, nissāya te vatthabbanti. Yass'āyasmato khamati, Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno niyasa-kammassa karaṇaṃ, nissāya te vatthabbanti, so tuṇh'assa. Yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.</p>

<p>Dutiyam-pi etam-atthaṃ vadāmi. Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho... so bhāseyya.</p>

<p>Tatiyam-pi etam-atthaṃ vadāmi. Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho... so bhāseyya.</p>

<p>Kataṃ saṅghena Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno niyasa-kammaṃ, nissāya te vatthabbanti. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī. Evam-etaṃ dhārayāmi.</p>

<p><i>Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. This Bhikkhu (name) is a maker of strife, quarrels, disputes, dissension, issues in the Community. If the Community is ready, it should impose a demotion transaction on Bhikkhu (name), [saying,] &quot;You are to live in dependence.&quot; This is the motion.</i></p>

The Community is imposing a demotion transaction on Bhikkhu (name), [saying,] &quot;You are to live in dependence.&quot; He to whom the imposition of a demotion transaction on Bhikkhu (name), [saying,] &quot;You are to live in dependence,&quot; is agreeable should remain silent. He to whom it is not agreeable should speak.</i></p>

<p><i>A second time... A third time I speak about this matter. Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me... He to whom it is not agreeable should speak.</i></p>

<p><i>The Community has imposed a demotion transaction on Bhikkhu (name), [saying,] &quot;You are to live in dependence.&quot; This is agreeable to the Community, therefore it is silent. Thus do I hold it.</i></p>

<h1>Note</h1>
<p><a id="fn-1"></a><a href="#fnt-1">1</a>.</p>

<p>Following the Thai edition. The Sri Lankan, Burmese, and PTS editions read, &quot;nissaya-kammaṃ&quot;: a dependence transaction.</p>

<p>The list of variations for this transaction is the same as that for censure.</p>

<h3>D. Banishment</h3> <h4>Transaction statement: (Cv.I.13.7)</h4>
<p>Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho. Ayaṃ Itthannāmo bhikkhu <strong><i>kāyika-vācasikena micchājīvena samannāgato hoti.</i></strong> Yadi saṅghassa pattakallaṃ, saṅgho Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno (name of place in ablative) pabbājanīya-kammaṃ kareyya, na Itthannāmena bhikkhuna (name of place in locative) vatthabbanti. Esā ñatti.</p>

<p>Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho.

Yassa nakkhamati, so bhāseyya.</p>

<p>Dutiyam-pi etam-atthaṃ vadāmi. Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho... so bhāseyya.</p>

<p>Tatiyam-pi etam-atthaṃ vadāmi. Suṇātu me bhante saṅgho... so bhāseyya.</p>

<p>Kataṃ saṅghena Itthannāmassa bhikkhuno (name of place in ablative) pabbājanīya-kammaṃ, na Itthannāmena bhikkhuna (name of place in locative) vatthabbanti. Khamati saṅghassa, tasmā tuṇhī. Evam-etaṃ dhārayāmi.</p>

<p><i>Venerable sirs, may the Community listen to me. This Bhikkhu (name) is endowed with bodily and verbal wrong livelihood. If the Community is ready, it should perform a transaction banishing Bhikkhu (name) from (place), [saying,] &quot;Bhikkhu (name) is not to live in (place).&quot; This is the motion.</i></p>

<p>None of the texts mention the transaction for rescinding a further-misconduct transaction. However, Cv.IV.12.4 contains instructions for how a bhikkhu on whom this transaction has been imposed should behave. (These instructions are identical with those for a censure transaction.) In every other instance where instructions of this sort are given, the bhikkhu — having followed the instructions — may then request that the transaction be rescinded. Thus, the silence of the texts on the rescinding of this transaction must be regarded as an oversight.</p>
