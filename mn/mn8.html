<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling at Svatthi
in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. Then in the evening time, the
venerable Maha Cunda, having emerged from seclusion, by which way [led to]
the Auspicious One, by that way he approached. Having approached the
Auspicious One, having bowed down, he sat down to one side. Having sat down
to one side, the venerable Maha Cunda said this to the Auspicious One:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“These various views, O Bhante, which arise in the world in connection
with the doctrine of self or in connection with the doctrine of the world,
for a bhikkhu who is attending to the very starting point [of wholesome
dhammas], does the abandoning of these views come to be thus? Does the
relinquishing of these views come to be thus?”

These various views, O Cunda, which arise in the world in connection with
the doctrine of self or in connection with the doctrine of the world, if
where these views arise, and where they underlie, and where they roam about,
that one sees just this with right wisdom as it has come to be: “Not this
is mine, not this I am, not this is my self,” thus the abandoning
of these views comes to be, thus the relinquishing of these views comes to
be.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
It is possible here, O Cunda, that quite secluded from sense-desires,
secluded from unwholesome dhammas, a certain bhikkhu here enters upon and
abides in the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion connected with thinking
and pondering, the first jhana. It occurs to him thus: “I am abiding in
effacement.” But these attainments, O Cunda, are not called
effacement in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called pleasant abidings
here and now in the Noble One's Discipline.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
It is possible here, O Cunda, that from the subsiding of thinking and
pondering, with the internal tranquilization and unification of mind,
without thinking, without pondering, a certain bhikkhu here enters upon and
abides in the rapture and pleasure born of samadhi, the second jhana. It
occurs to him thus: “I am abiding in effacement.” But these
attainments, O Cunda, are not called effacement in the Noble One's
Discipline: these are called pleasant abidings here and now in the Noble
One's Discipline.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
It is possible here, O Cunda, that with the fading away of rapture, a
certain bhikkhu here dwelling mindful and clearly comprehending, looks on
with equanimity as he experiences pleasure in the body, of which the Noble
Ones say: “He is a mindful one who [looks on with] equanimity, one who
dwells in pleasure.” He enters upon and abides in the third
jhana. It occurs to him thus: “I am abiding in effacement.” But
these attainments, O Cunda, are not called effacement in the Noble One's
Discipline: these are called pleasant abidings here and now in the Noble
One's Discipline.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
It is possible here, O Cunda, that with the abandoning of [physical]
pleasure and pain, from the extinction of former mental pleasure and mental
pain, a certain bhikkhu here enters upon and abides in the utter purity of
mindfulness and equanimity, without pain, without pleasure, the fourth
jhana. It occurs to him thus: “I am abiding in effacement.” But
these attainments, O Cunda, are not called effacement in the Noble One's
Discipline: these are called pleasant abidings here and now in the Noble
One's Discipline.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
It is possible here, O Cunda, that from the complete surmounting of
perceptions of form, from the extinquishing of perceptions of resistance,
from non-attention to perceptions of diversity, “space is
infinite,” a certain bhikkhu here enters and dwells in the domain
of infinite space. It occurs to him thus: “I am abiding in
effacement.” But these attainments, O Cunda, are not called
effacement in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called peaceful abidings
here and now in the Noble One's Discipline.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
It is possible here, O Cunda, that having completely surmounted the domain
of infinite space, “consciousness is infinite,” a certain
bhikkhu here enters and dwells in the domain of infinite consciousness. It
occurs to him thus: “I am abiding in effacement.” But these
attainments, O Cunda, are not called effacement in the Noble One's
Discipline: these are called peaceful abidings here and now in the Noble
One's Discipline.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
It is possible here, O Cunda, that having completely surmounted the domain
of infinite consciousness, “there is nothing,” a certain bhikkhu
here enters and dwells in the domain of nothingness. It occurs to him thus:
“I am abiding in effacement.” But these attainments, O Cunda,
are not called effacement in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called
peaceful abidings here and now in the Noble One's Discipline.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
It is possible here, O Cunda, that having completely surmounted the domain
of nothingness, a certain bhikkhu here enters and dwells in the domain of
neither perception nor non-perception. It occurs to him thus: “I am
abiding in effacement.” But these attainments, O Cunda, are not
called effacement in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called peaceful
abidings here and now in the Noble One's Discipline.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>

O Cunda, I say that even the inclination of mind towards wholesome dhammas
is of great benefit, so what should be said of bodily and verbal acts
conforming to such a state of mind? Therefore, O Cunda:

the course of extinguishing has been taught by me. Whatever should be done,
O Cunda, by a teacher for his disciples, desiring their welfare, having pity
for them, that has been done for you by me, out of compassion. These are the
feet of trees, O Cunda, these are empty huts. Meditate, O Cunda, do not be
