Thus was heard by me: At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling in
Sāvatthi at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. At that place the Auspicious
One addressed the bhikkhus: Bhikkhus. [Yes] Bhante, those bhikkhus replied
to the Auspicious One. The Auspicious One said this:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“The classification of the six [sense] domains, O bhikkhus, I will
expound for you. Listen to that and do mind it well, I will speak.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“Yes Bhante.” Those bhikkhus replied to the Auspicious One. The
Auspicious One said this:

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
“The six internal domains should be known. The six external domains
should be known. The six forms of consciousness should be known. The six
forms of contact should be known. The eighteen mental ponderings should be
known. The thirty six paths of beings should be known. Therein, in
dependence on this, you must abandon this. The three establishments of
mindfulness which the Noble One exemplifies, exemplifying which, the Noble
One is the Teacher worthy to lead a group.” Among teachers of
training, he is called “the unsurpassed charioteer of tamed
persons.” This is the outline of the classification of the six
[sense] domains.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“The six internal domains should be known.” Yet, this was said
thus. On account of what was this said? The eye domain, the ear domain, the
nose domain, the tongue domain, the body domain, the mind domain. “The
six internal domains should be known.” That which was said thus, it
is on account of this here that it was said. “The six external domains
should be known.” Yet this was said thus. On account of what was
this said? The form domain, the sound domain, the aroma domain, the flavour
domain, the tangible domain, the dhammas domain. “The six external
domains should be known.” That which was said thus, it is on
account of this here that it was said.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
“The six forms of consciousness should be known.” Yet this was
said thus. On account of what was this said? The eye consciousness, the ear
consciousness, the nose consciousness, the tongue consciousness, the body
consciousness, the mind consciousness. “The six forms of consciousness
should be known.” That which was said thus, it is on account of
this here that it was said.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
“The six forms of contact should be known.” Yet this was said
thus. On account of what was this said? The eye contact, the ear contact,
the nose contact, the tongue contact, the body contact, the mind
contact. “The six forms of contact should be known.” That which
was said thus, it is on account of this here that it was said.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
“The eighteen mental ponderings should be known.” Yet this was
said thus. On account of what was this said? Having seen forms with the eye,
one ponders a mental pleasure based on forms, one ponders a mental pain
based on forms, one ponders equanimity based on forms. Having heard sounds
with the ear, one ponders a mental pleasure based on sounds, one ponders a
mental pain based on sounds, one ponders equanimity based on sounds. Having
smelled aromas with the nose, one ponders a mental pleasure based on aromas,
one ponders a mental pain based on aromas, one ponders equanimity based on
aromas. Having tasted flavors with the tongue, one ponders a mental pleasure
based on flavors, one ponders a mental pain based on flavors, one ponders
equanimity based on flavors. Having touched tangibles with the body, one
ponders a mental pleasure based on tangibles, one ponders a mental pain
based on tangibles, one ponders equanimity based on tangibles. Having
cognized dhammas with the mind, one ponders a mental pleasure based on
dhammas, one ponders a mental pain based on dhammas, one ponders equanimity
based on dhammas. Thus, [there are] six mental pleasure ponderings, six
mental pain ponderings, six equanimity ponderings. “The eighteen mental
ponderings should be known.” That which was said thus, it is on
account of this here that it was said.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
“The thirty six paths of beings should be known.” Yet this was
said thus. On account of what was this said? The six mental pleasures
connected with the household life, the six mental pleasures connected with
renunciation, the six mental pains connected with the household life, the
six mental pains connected with renunciation, the six equanimity connected
with the household life, the six equanimity connected with renunciation.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Therein, what are the six mental pleasures connected with the household
life? Perceiving the acquisition of forms cognizable by the eye that are
agreeable, lovely, pleasing, delightful, connected with worldly gains, or
from calling to mind a former acquisition, having obtained before, that have
passed, ceased, changed, mental pleasure arises. Such a form of mental
pleasure as this is called the mental pleasure connected with the household
life. Perceiving the acquisition of sounds cognizable by the ear that are

pleasure as this is called the mental pleasure connected with the household
life. Perceiving the acquisition of dhammas cognizable by the mind that are

pleasure as this is called the mental pleasure connected with the household
life. These are the six mental pleasures connected with the household life.

Therein, what are the six mental pains connected with the household life?
Perceiving the non-acquisition of forms cognizable by the eye that are
agreeable, lovely, pleasing, delightful, connected with worldly gains, or

known just the impermanence, changing, fading away and cessation of forms,
and also having seen just this with right wisdom as it has come to be:
“forms formerly and at present, all those forms are impermanent,
suffering and liable to change,” one arouses a yearning for the
unsurpassed liberations [thus]: “O when indeed will I enter upon and

enter upon and dwell in?” Mental pain arises in dependence on
arousing of the yearning. Such a form of mental pain as this is called the

Therein, what are the six [forms of] equanimity connected with the household
life? Having seen forms with the eye, equanimity arises for a foolish,
confused puthujjana, one who has not conquered the confinements [imposed by
the six sense domains], one who has not conquered results [not having seen
where results of kamma cease without remainder], one who is blind to danger
[in samsara], one to whom hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, the
puthujjana. Such a form of equanimity does not transcend the form, therefore
that is called the equanimity connected with the household life. Having
heard sounds with the ear, equanimity arises for a foolish, confused
puthujjana, one who has not conquered the confinements [imposed by the six
sense domains], one who has not conquered results [not having seen where
results of kamma cease without remainder], one who is blind to danger [in
samsara], one to whom hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, the
puthujjana. Such a form of equanimity does not transcend the sound,
therefore that is called the equanimity connected with the household
life. Having smelled an aroma with the nose, equanimity arises for a
foolish, confused puthujjana, one who has not conquered the confinements
[imposed by the six sense domains], one who has not conquered results [not
having seen where results of kamma cease without remainder], one who is
blind to danger [in samsara], one to whom hearing [of the Dhamma] does not
come to be, the puthujjana. Such a form of equanimity does not transcend the
aroma, therefore that is called the equanimity connected with the household
life. Having tasted a flavor with the tongue, equanimity arises for a
foolish, confused puthujjana, one who has not conquered the confinements
[imposed by the six sense domains], one who has not conquered results [does
not see where results of kamma cease without remainder], one who is blind to
danger [in samsara], one to whom hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to
be, the puthujjana. Such a form of equanimity does not transcend the flavor,
therefore that is called the equanimity connected with the household
life. Having touched a tangible with the body, equanimity arises for a
foolish, confused puthujjana, one who has not conquered the confinements
[imposed by the six sense domains], one who has not conquered results [does
not see where results of kamma cease without remainder], one who is blind to
danger [in samsara], one to whom hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to
be, the puthujjana. Such a form of equanimity does not transcend the
tangible, therefore that is called the equanimity connected with the
household life. Having cognized a dhamma with the mind, equanimity arises
for a foolish, confused puthujjana, one who has not conquered the
confinements [imposed by the six sense domains], one who has not conquered
results [does not see where results of kamma cease without remainder], one
who is blind to danger [in samsara], one to whom hearing [of the Dhamma]
does not come to be, the puthujjana. Such a form of equanimity does not

dhammas are impermanent, suffering and liable to change,”
equanimity arises. Such form of equanimity as this transcends the dhamma,
therefore that is called the equanimity connected with renunciation. These
are the six [forms of] equanimity connected with renunciation. “The
thirty six paths of beings should be known.” That which was said
thus, it is on account of this here that it was said.

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
Therein, in dependence on this, you must abandon this. Yet this was said
thus. On account of what was this said? Therein, O bhikkhus, that which are
the six mental pleasures connected with renunciation, in dependence on that,
by means of that, you must abandon, you must surmount that which is the six
mental pleasures connected with the household life. Thus, is their
abandoning, thus is their surmounting. Therein, O bhikkhus, that which are
the six mental pains connected with renunciation, in dependence on that, by
means of that, you must abandon, you must surmount that which is the six
mental pains connected with the household life. Thus, is their abandoning,
thus is their surmounting. Therein, O bhikkhus, that which are the six
[forms of] equanimity connected with renunciation, in dependence on that, by
means of that, you must abandon, you must surmount that which is the six
[forms of] equanimity connected with the household life. Thus, is their
abandoning, thus is their surmounting. Therein, O bhikkhus, that which are
the six mental pleasures connected with renunciation, in dependence on that,
by means of that, you must abandon, you must surmount that which is the six
mental pains connected with renunciation. Thus, is their abandoning, thus is
their surmounting. Therein, O bhikkhus, that which are the six [forms of]
equanimity connected with renunciation, in dependence on that, by means of
that, you must abandon, you must surmount that which is the six mental
pleasures connected with renunciation. Thus, is their abandoning, thus is
their surmounting.

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
There is, O bhikkhus, diversified equanimity, connected with
diversity. There is unified equanimity, connected with unity. And which, O
bhikkhus, is the diversified equanimity, connected with diversity? There is,
O bhikkhus, equanimity in forms, there is [equanimity] in sounds, there is
[equanimity] in aromas, there is [equanimity] in flavors, there is
[equanimity] in tangibles. This, O bhikkhus is the diversified equanimity,
connected with diversity.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
And which, O bhikkhus, is unified equanimity, connected with unity? There
is, O bhikkhus, equanimity depending on the domain of infinite space, there
is [equanimity] depending on domain of infinite consciousness, there is
[equanimity] depending on domain of nothingness, there is [equanimity]
depending on domain of neither perception nor non-perception. This, O
bhikkhus, is unified equanimity, connected with unity. Therein, O bhikkhus,
that which is unified equanimity, connected with unity, in dependence on
that, by means of that, you must abandon, you must surmount that which is
the diversified equanimity, connected with diversity.Thus, is their
abandoning, thus is their surmounting. Not-made-of-that-ness, O bhikkhus, in
dependence on not-made-of-that-ness, by means of that, you must abandon, you
must surmount that which is the unified equanimity, connected with unity.
Thus, is their abandoning, thus is their surmounting. “Therein, in
dependence on this, you must abandon this.” That which was said
thus, it is on account of this here that it was said.

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
The three establishments of mindfulness which the Noble One exemplifies,
exemplifying which, the Noble One is the Teacher worthy to lead a
group.” Yet this was said thus. On account of what was this said?
“Here, O bhikkhus, compassionate, desiring their welfare, the Teacher
teaches the Dhamma for his disciples out of compassion [thus] “this is
for your welfare, this is for your happiness.”. Of that the
disciples do not listen. They do not give ear attentively. They do not apply
their minds to understand it. They carry on having turned aside from the
Teacher's instructions. Therein, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata is just not
contented and experiences no contentment. [Yet] not filled with desire, he
abides mindful and clearly comprehending. This, O bhikkhus, is the first

“Furthermore, O bhikkhus, compassionate, desiring their welfare, the
Teacher teaches the Dhamma for his disciples out of compassion [thus]
“this is for your welfare, this is for your happiness.”. Of
that, some of the disciples do not listen. They do not give ear
attentively. They do not apply their minds to understand it. They carry on
having turned aside from the Teacher's instructions. Some of the disciples
listen. They give ear attentively. They apply their minds to understand
it. They do not carry on having turned aside from the Teacher's
instructions. Therein, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata is just not contented and
experiences no contentment, and not discontented and experiences no
discontentment. Having avoided both contentment and discontentment, he
abides equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending. This, O bhikkhus, is
the second establishment of mindfulness, which the Noble One exemplifies,
exemplifying which, the Noble One is the Teacher worthy to lead a
group.”

Among teachers of training, he is called “the unsurpassed charioteer of
tamed persons.” Yet this was said thus. On account of what was this
said? Led by the elephant tamer, O bhikkhus, the tamed elephant runs along
only one direction, eastern or western or northern or southern. Led by the
horse tamer, O bhikkhus, the tamed horse runs along only one direction,
eastern or western or northern or southern. Led by the bull tamer, O
bhikkhus, the tamed bull runs along only one direction, eastern or western
or northern or southern. Indeed, led by the Tathagata, the Arahant, the
rightly self-awakened One, the tamed person roams in eight directions. One
possessed of form sees forms. This is the first direction. Not percipient of
internal forms, one sees external forms. This is the second direction. One
is intent on just this: “the beautiful”. This is the third
direction. From the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, from the
extinquishing of perceptions of resistance, from non-attention to
perceptions of diversity, “space is infinite,” one enters and
dwells in the domain of infinite space. This is the fourth direction. Having
completely surmounted the domain of infinite space, “consciousness is
infinite,” one enters and dwells in the domain of infinite
consciousness. This is the fifth direction. Having completely surmounted the
domain of infinite consciousness, “there is nothing,” one enters
and dwells in the domain of nothingness. This is the sixth direction. Having
completely surmounted the domain of nothingness, one enters and dwells in
the domain of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the seventh
direction. Having completely surmounted the domain of neither perception nor
non-perception, one enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and
feeling. This is the eighth direction. Indeed, led by the Tathagata, the
Arahant, the rightly self-awakened One, the tamed person roams in these
eight directions. Among teachers of training, he is called “the
unsurpassed charioteer of tamed persons.” That which was said thus,
it is on account of this here that it was said.

This is what the Auspicious One said. Delighted, those bhikkhus rejoiced in
the Auspicious One's words.
