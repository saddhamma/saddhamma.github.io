Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling at
Nalanda, in the Pavarika Mango Grove. At that time, Nigantha Nataputta lived
at Nalanda with a large assembly of Nigaṇṭhas. It so happened that
Dighatapassi, the Nigantha, having wandered in Nalanda for alms food, after
his meal, having gone back after alms gathering, by which way [led to] the
Pavarika Mango Grove, by that way he approached the Auspicious One. Having
approached the Auspicious One, he exchanged friendly greetings. Having
exchanged friendly greetings and cordial talk, he stood to one side. [While]
standing to one side, the Auspicious One said this to Dighatapassi, the
Nigantha: “There are seats, Tapassi. Sit down if you wish.” When
thus was said, Dighatapassi, the Nigantha, having grabbed a certain lower
seat, sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the Auspicious One
said this to Dighatapassi, the Nigantha:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“But Tapassi, how many actions does Nigantha Nataputta declare for the
performance of evil kamma, for the activation of evil kamma?”
Friend Gotama, it is not the practice of Niganṭha Nataputta to declare
“action, action.” Friend Gotama, it is the practice of Nigantha
Nataputta to declare “cane, cane.” “But Tapassi, how many
canes does Nigantha Nataputta declare for the performance of evil kamma, for
the activation of evil kamma?” Friend Gotama, Nigantha Nataputta
declares three canes for the performance of evil kamma, for the activation
of evil kamma. Namely: bodily cane, verbal cane, mental cane.”
“But Tapassi, is the bodily cane one, the verbal cane another, and the
mental cane yet another?” “Friend Gotama, the bodily cane is
one, the verbal cane is another, and the mental cane is yet
another.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
But Tapassi, of these three canes thus defined, thus distinguished, which
cane does Nigantha Nataputta declare to be the most blameworthy for the
performance of evil kamma, for the activation of evil kamma, whether the
bodily cane, the verbal cane, or the mental cane?” “Friend
Gotama, of these three canes thus defined, thus distinguished, Nigantha
Nataputta declares the bodily cane to be the most blameworthy for the
performance of evil kamma, for the activation of evil kamma, not so the
verbal cane, not so the mental cane.” “Do you say “bodily
cane,” Tapassi? I say “bodily cane,” friend Gotama. Do
you say “bodily cane,” Tapassi? I say “bodily cane,”
friend Gotama. Do you say “bodily cane,” Tapassi? I say
“bodily cane,” friend Gotama.” Thus indeed the
Auspicious One cause Dighatapassi, the Nigantha to establish this point of
dispute as far as the third time.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
When thus was said, Dighatapassi, the Nigantha, said this to the Auspicious
One: “But you, friend Gotama, how many canes do you declare for the
performance of evil kamma, for the activation of evil kamma?” O
Tapassi, it is not the practice of the Tathagata to declare “cane,
cane.” Tapassi, it is the practice of the Tathagata to declare
“action, action.” “But you, friend Gotama, how many actions
do you declare for the performance of evil kamma, for the activation of evil
kamma?” I, O Tapassi, declare three actions for the performance of
evil kamma, for the activation of evil kamma. Namely: bodily action, verbal
action, mental action.” “But friend Gotama, is the bodily action
one, the verbal action another, and the mental action yet another?”
“Tapassi, the bodily action is one, the verbal action is another, and the
mental action is yet another.”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
But friend Gotama, of these three actions thus defined, thus distinguished,
which action do you declare to be the most blameworthy for the performance
of evil kamma, for the activation of evil kamma, whether the bodily action,
the verbal action, or the mental action?” “Tapassi, of these
three actions thus defined, thus distinguished, I declare the mental action
to be the most blameworthy for the performance of evil kamma, for the
activation of evil kamma, not so the bodily action, not so the verbal
action.” “Do you say “mental action,” friend Gotama?
I say “mental action,” O Tapassi. Do you say “mental
action,” friend Gotama? I say “mental action,” O
Tapassi. Do you say “mental action,” friend Gotama? I say
“mental action,” O Tapassi.” Thus indeed Dighatapassi,
the Nigantha, having caused the Auspicious One to establish this point of
dispute as far as the third time, having risen up from his seat, by which
way [led to] Nigantha Nataputta, by that way he approached.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
At that time, Nigantha Nataputta was seated with a large assembly of lay
people consisting of fools, headed by Upali. Nigantha Nataputta saw
Dighatapassi, the Nigaṇṭha from afar approaching. Having seen, he said this
to Dighatapassi, the Nigantha: “Well Tapassi, where are you coming from,
in the middle of the day?” “Indeed I, O Bhante, am coming from
the presence of the samana Gotama.” But Tapassi, for you was there
also some conversation with the samana Gotama? For me O Bhante, there was
also some conversation with the samana Gotama. But for you, Tapassi, in
which way was there also some conversation with the samana Gotama? Then
Dighatapassi, the Nigantha, reported to Nigantha Nataputta the extent of all
the friendly conversation he had with the Auspicious One. When thus was
said, Nigantha Nataputta said this to Dighatapassi, the Nigantha: “Good,
good Tapassi. Just as happens from a learned disciple who rightly
understands the Teacher's dispensation, just so has Dighatapassi, the
Nigantha answered to the samana Gotama. [For] how indeed, can this low
mental cane shine thus in comparison with the gross bodily cane. Rather, the
bodily cane is the most blameworthy for the performance of evil kamma, for
the activation of evil kamma, not so the verbal cane, not so the mental
cane.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
When thus was said, Upali, the head of household, said this to Nigantha
Nataputta: “Good, good, [for] the venerable Tapassi. Just as happens from
a learned disciple who rightly understands the Teacher's dispensation, just
so has the venerable Tapassi answered to the samana Gotama. [For] how
indeed, can this low mental cane shine thus, in comparison with the gross
bodily cane. Rather, the bodily cane is the most blameworthy for the
performance of evil kamma, for the activation of evil kamma, not so the
verbal cane, not so the mental cane. Well now, O Bhante, I must go. I will
refute the samana Gotama's doctrine on this point of dispute. If the samana
Gotama will establish it for me thus, as established with the venerable
Tapassi, [then] just as a strong man, having seized a long haired wild goat
by the hair, might drag it forward, might drag it about, might drag it this
way and that way, in the same way, statement by statement, I will drag the
samana Gotama forward, I will drag him about, I will drag him this way and
that way. Just as a strong brewer, having placed a large distilling basket
in a deep pond, might drag it forward, might drag it about, might drag it
this way and that way, in the same way, statement by statement, I will drag
the samana Gotama forward, I will drag him about, I will drag him this way
and that way. Just as a strong brewer's mixer, having grasped a sieve, might
toss it, might shake it, might throw it about, in the same way, statement by
statement, I will toss the samana Gotama, I will shake him, I will throw him
about. Just as an elephant, sixty years old, having plunged into a deep
lotus pond, might play the game called hemp-washing, in the same way, I
think I will play the game of hemp-washing with the samana Gotama. Well now,
I, O Bhante, will go to refute the samana Gotama's doctrine on this point of
dispute.” “Go you, head of household, refute the samana Gotama's
doctrine on this point of dispute. Indeed, head of household, either I would
refute the samana Gotama's doctrine, or Dighatapassi, the Nigantha, or
you.”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
When thus was said, Dighatapassi, the Nigantha said this to Nigantha
Nataputta: “This is not pleasing to me, O Bhante, that Upali, the head of
household, would refute the samana Gotama's doctrine. Indeed, O Bhante, the
samana Gotamo is a magician. He knows a converting magic, with which he
converts the disciples of other standpoints.” “This is
impossible, O Tapassi, there is no chance, in that Upali, the head of
household, might undertake discipleship [under] the samana Gotama. But this
possibility is to be found in that the samana Gotama might undertake
discipleship under Upali, the head of household. Go you, head of household,
refute the samana Gotama's doctrine on this point of dispute. Indeed, head
of household, either I would refute the samana Gotama's doctrine, or
Dighatapassi, the Nigantha, or you.”Also for a second time,
Dighatapassi, the Nigantha said this to Nigantha Nataputta: “This is not
pleasing to me, O Bhante, that Upali, the head of household, would refute
the samana Gotama's doctrine. Indeed, O Bhante, the samana Gotamo is a
magician. He knows a converting magic, with which he converts the disciples
of other standpoints.” “This is impossible, O Tapassi, there is
no chance, in that Upali, the head of household, might undertake
discipleship [under] the samana Gotama. But this possibility is to be found
in that the samana Gotama might undertake discipleship under Upali, the head
of household. Go you, head of household, refute the samana Gotama's doctrine
on this point of dispute. Indeed, head of household, either I would refute
the samana Gotama's doctrine, or Dighatapassi, the Nigantha, or
you.” Also for a third time, Dighatapassi, the Nigantha said this
to Nigantha Nataputta: “This is not pleasing to me, O Bhante, that Upali,
the head of household, would refute the samana Gotama's doctrine. Indeed, O
Bhante, the samana Gotamo is a magician. He knows a converting magic, with
which he converts the disciples of other standpoints.” “This is
impossible, O Tapassi, there is no chance, in that Upali, the head of
household, might undertake discipleship [under] the samana Gotama. But this
possibility is to be found in that the samana Gotama might undertake
discipleship under Upali, the head of household. Go you, head of household,
refute the samana Gotama's doctrine on this point of dispute. Indeed, head
of household, either I would refute the samana Gotama's doctrine, or
Dighatapassi, the Nigantha, or you.”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
“Yes, Bhante,” Upali, the head of household, having replied to
Nigantha Nataputta, having risen up from his seat, having bowed down, having
circumambulated Nigantha Nataputta, by which way [led to] to the Pavarika
Mango Grove, by that way he approached Auspicious One. Having approached the
Auspicious One, having bowed down, he sat down to one side. Having sat down
to one side, Upali, the head of household said this to the Auspicious One:
“Bhante, did Dighatapassi, the Nigantha come here?” “Head of
household, Dighatapassi, the Nigantha did come here?” But Bhante,
for you was there also some conversation with the Dighatapassi, the
Nigantha? For me O head of household, there was also some conversation with
the Dighatappasi, the Nigantha. But for you, Bhante, in which way was there
also some conversation with the Dighatappasi, the Nigantha? Then the
Auspicious One reported to Upali, the head of household, the extent of all
the friendly conversation he had with Dighatapassi, the Nigantha.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
When thus was said, Upali, the head of household said this to Dighatapassi,
the nigaṇṭha: “Good, good, [for] Tapassi. Just as happens from a learned
disciple who rightly understands the Teacher's dispensation, just so has
Dighatapassi, the Nigantha answered to the Auspicious One. [For] how indeed,
can this low mental cane shine thus, in comparison with the gross bodily
cane. Rather, the bodily cane is the most blameworthy for the performance of
evil kamma, for the activation of evil kamma, not so the verbal cane, not so
the mental cane.” “If you, head of household, would discuss
based on truth, there might be a conversation for us here. I, O Bhante, will
discuss based on truth, [so] let there be a conversation for us
here.”

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
“So what do you think, O head of household? Here, a Nigantha is
afflicted, in pain, severely ill, a refuser of cool water, one committed to
[the practice of accepting only] hot water. He, not obtaining cool water,
would die. Now, head of household, where does Nigantha Nataputta declare for
his rebirth?” “There are, O Bhante, devas named mental beings,
he is reborn in that place. What is the reason for that? Because, O Bhante,
he was bound up with mind when he died.” Head of household! Head of
household! Having paid attention, [only then] answer. Head of household!
Your later [statement] does not agree with your former [statement], nor does
your former [statement agree with] your later [statement]. Yet head of
household, this statement was made by you, “I, O Bhante, will discuss
based on truth, [so] let there be a conversation for us here.”
However much, O Bhante, the Auspicious One has said thus, rather, the bodily
cane is the most blameworthy for the performance of evil kamma, for the
activation of evil kamma, not so the verbal cane, not so the mental
cane.”

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
“So what do you think, O head of household? Here, a Nigantha is
restrained by the restraint of the fourfold restraint, one restrained by all
restraints, one devoted to all restraints, one who shakes off by all
restraint, one pervaded by all restraint. [While] going forward and going
backwards, he brings destruction to many tiny living beings. Now for this, O
head of household, what does Nigantha Nataputta declare for the results [of
kamma]?” “Nigantha Nataputta, O Bhante, does not declare the
unintentional to be very blameworthy.” “But, O head of
household, what if it is intentional?” “It is very blameworthy,
O Bhante.” “But, O head of household, rooted in what, does
Nigantha Nataputta declare for intention?” “In the mental cane,
O Bhante.” “Head of household! Head of household! Having paid
attention, [only then] answer. Head of household! Your later [statement]
does not agree with your former [statement], nor does your former [statement
agree with] your later [statement]. Yet head of household , this statement
was made by you, “I, O Bhante, will discuss based on truth, [so] let
there be a conversation for us here.” However much, O Bhante, the
Auspicious One has said thus, rather, the bodily cane is the most
blameworthy for the performance of evil kamma, for the activation of evil
kamma, not so the verbal cane, not so the mental cane.”

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
“So what do you think, O head of household, is this Nalanda just
successful and prosperous and has many people, crowded with
humans?” “Yes, Bhante. This Nalanda is just successful and
prosperous and has many people, crowded with humans?” “So what
do you think, O head of household? Here, a man might come with a drawn
sword. He might say thus: “As far as this Nalanda [extends], by one
moment, by one instant, I will make those living beings [in it] one mash of
flesh, one heap of flesh.” “What do you think about that, O head
of household? Is the man able to make those living beings into one mash of
flesh, one heap of flesh by one moment, by one instant, as far as this
Nalanda [extends]?” “Even ten men, O Bhante, even twenty men,
even thirty men, even fourty men, even fifty men are not sufficient to make
those living beings into one mash of flesh, one heap of flesh by one moment,
by one instant, as far as this Nalanda [extends]. How indeed, can one low
man shine?”

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
“So what do you think, O head of household? Here, a samana or brahmana
might come endowed with superhuman powers, one attained to mastery of
mind. He might say thus: “I will make this Nalanda into ashes with one
mental act of hate.” What do you think about that, O head of
household? Is the samana or brahmana endowed with superhuman powers, one
attained to mastery of mind, able to make this Nalanda into ashes by one
mental act of hate?” “Even ten Nalandas, O Bhante, even twenty
Nalandas, even thirty Nalandas, even forty Nalandas, even fifty Nalandas, a
samana or brahmana endowed with superhuman powers, one attained to mastery
of mind, can make into ashes with one mental act of hate. How indeed, can
one low Nalanda shine?” “Head of household! Head of household!
Having paid attention, [only then] answer. Head of household! Your later
[statement] does not agree with your former [statement], nor does your
former [statement agree with] your later [statement]. Yet head of household
, this statement was made by you, “I, O Bhante, will discuss based on
truth, [so] let there be a conversation for us here.” However much,
O Bhante, the Auspicious One has said thus, rather, the bodily cane is the
most blameworthy for the performance of evil kamma, for the activation of
evil kamma, not so the verbal cane, not so the mental cane.”

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
“So what do you think, O head of household? Have you heard [of how] the
Dandaka forest, the Kalinga forest, the Mejjha forest, the Matanga forest,
came to be forests?” Yes, Bhante. I have heard [of how] the Dandaka
forest, the Kalinga forest, the Mejjha forest, the Matanga forest, came to
be forests?” “So what do you think, O head of household? How
precisely have you heard [of how] the Dandaka forest, the Kalinga forest,
the Mejjha forest, the Matanga forest, came to be forests?” I have
heard, O Bhante, that the Dandaka forest, the Kalinga forest, the Mejjha
forest, the Matanga forest, came to be forests by the seers' mental act of
hate.” “Head of household! Head of household! Having paid
attention, [only then] answer. Head of household! Your later [statement]
does not agree with your former [statement], nor does your former [statement
agree with] your later [statement]. Yet head of household, this statement
was made by you, “I, O Bhante, will discuss based on truth, [so] let
there be a conversation for us here.”

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
“O Bhante, I was even contented and satisfied with the Auspicious One's
first simile, but wishing to hear the Auspicious One's manifold readiness of
speech on the question, I thought [I] just ought to oppose the Auspicious
One. Excellent! O Bhante. Excellent! O Bhante. Just as, O Bhante, one might
set upright what has been overturned, or open up what has been closed, or
show a path to one who is lost, or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so that
those with good eyesight can see forms, just so has the Dhamma been
explained by the Auspicious One in countless ways. I go, O Bhante, to the
Auspicious One, as refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of
bhikkhus. May the Auspicious One bear it in mind, that I am a lay disciple
who has gone for refuge from today, for as long as life lasts.”

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
“Act through investigation, O head of household, It is good for
well-known men of your kind to act through investigation.” “In
this way, I, O Bhante, am even more contented and satisfied of the
Auspicious One, in that the Auspicious One has said to me thus: “Act
through investigation, O head of household, It is good for well-known men of
your kind to act through investigation.” Indeed, O Bhante,
followers of other standpoints, having gained me as a disciple, might carry
about a banner in almost the whole of Nalanda: “Upali, head of household,
has become a disciple of ours!” So now for the second time, I go, O
Bhante, to the Auspicious One, as refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the
Sangha of bhikkhus. May the Auspicious One bear it in mind, that I am a lay
disciple who has gone for refuge from today, for as long as life
lasts.”

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
“For a long time, for you O head of household, your family has become a
welling spring for the Nigaṇṭhas. Having approached for alms food, may you
think them fit to be given to.” “In this way, I, O Bhante, am
even more contented and satisfied of the Auspicious One, in that the
Auspicious One has said to me thus: “For a long time, for you O head of
household, your family has become a welling spring for the Nigaṇṭhas. Having
approached for alms food, may you think them fit to be given to.”
This was heard by me, O Bhante. The samana Gotama has said thus: Gift is fit
to be given only for me. Gift is not fit to be given for others. Gift is fit
to be given only for my disciples. Gift is not fit to be given for others
disciples. Only gifts given for me bear great fruits. Gifts given for others
do not bear great fruits. Only gifts given for my disciples bear great
fruits. Gifts given for others disciples do not bear great fruits.”
Yet now, the Auspicious One instigates for me to offer gifts to the
Niganthas too. Nevertheless, O Bhante, we will know the time here. So now
for the third time, I go, O Bhante, to the Auspicious One, as refuge, and to
the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. May the Auspicious One bear it in
mind, that I am a lay disciple who has gone for refuge from today, for as
long as life lasts.”

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
Then for Upali, head of household, the Auspicious One taught a graduated
discourse. That is, talk on generosity, talk on virtue, talk on heaven,
explaining the danger, degradation and defilements of sense desires, and the
advantages of renunciation. When the Auspicious One knew that Upali, head of
household's mind was ready, pliable, free from the hindrances, joyful,
confident, he revealed in brief the teaching on Dhamma unique to the
Buddhas: suffering, origination, cessation, path. And just as a clean cloth
from which all stains have been removed, receives the dye perfectly, just so
for Upali, head of household, as he sat there, there arose the pure and
spotless Dhamma-eye: “Whatever is liable to origination, all that is
liable to cessation.” Then Upali, head of household, having seen
the Dhamma, reached the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, plunged into the Dhamma,
having crossed over doubt, being without uncertainty, having attained
self-confidence, having become independent of others in the Teacher's
dispensation, said this to the Auspicious One: “Well now, O Bhante, we
must go, as we have much duties, much to do.” “Now is the time,
O head of household, for you to do as you think fit.”

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
Then Upali, head of household, having delighted and rejoiced in the
Auspicious One's words, having risen up from his seat, having bowed down,
having circumambulated the Auspicious One, by which way [led to] his house,
by that way he approached. Having approached, he address the gate keeper:
From this day forth, good gate keeper, I shut my door to the Niganthas and
Niganthis. I open my door to the Auspicious One's bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, male
lay disciples and female lay disciples. If any Nigantha comes, you may say
thus to him: “Stay Bhante, do not enter. From this day forth, Upali, head
of household, has become the disciple of the samana Gotama. He shuts his
door to the Niganthas and Niganthis. He opens his door to the Auspicious
One's bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, male lay disciples and female lay disciples. If
you are one [wishing] to gain alms food, O Bhante, just stand here. They
will bring it for you just here.” Yes, Bhante,“” the
gatekeeper replied to Upali, head of household.

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
Dighatapassi, the Nigantha heard, apparently, Upali, head of household, has
become the disciple of the samana Gotama. So then, by which way [led to]
Nigantha Nataputta, by that way Dighatapassi, the Nigantha
approached. Having approached, he said this to Nigantha Nataputta: “This
was heard by me, O Bhante. They say Upali, head of household, has become the
disciple of the samana Gotama.” “This is impossible, O Tapassi,
there is no chance, in that Upali, the head of household, might undertake
discipleship [under] the samana Gotama. But this possibility is to be found
in that the samana Gotama might undertake discipleship under Upali, the head
of household.” Also for a second time, Dighatapassi, the Nigantha,
said this to Nigantha Nataputta: “This was heard by me, O Bhante. They
say Upali, head of household, has become the disciple of the samana
Gotama.” “This is impossible, O Tapassi, there is no chance, in
that Upali, the head of household, might undertake discipleship [under] the
samana Gotama. But this possibility is to be found in that the samana Gotama
might undertake discipleship under Upali, the head of household.”
Also for a third time, Dighatapassi, the Nigantha, said this to Nigantha
Nataputta: “This was heard by me, O Bhante. They say Upali, head of
household, has become the disciple of the samana Gotama.” “This
is impossible, O Tapassi, there is no chance, in that Upali, the head of
household, might undertake discipleship [under] the samana Gotama. But this
possibility is to be found in that the samana Gotama might undertake
discipleship under Upali, the head of household.” “Well now, O
Bhante, I must go. I must find out to what extent [this is true], whether
Upali, head of household, has become a disciple of the samana Gotama or
not.” “Go you Tapassi. Find out whether Upali, head of
household, has become a disciple of the samana Gotama or not.”

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
Then by which way [led to] Upali, head of household's house, by that way
Dighatapassi, the Nigantha approached. The gatekeeper saw Dighatapassi, the
Nigantha approaching from afar. Having seen, he said this to Dighatapassi,
the Nigantha. “Stand [here] O Bhante, do not enter. From this day forth,
Upali, head of household, has become the disciple of the samana Gotama. He
shuts his door to the Niganthas and Niganthis. He opens his door to the
Auspicious One's bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, male lay disciples and female lay
disciple. If you are one [wishing] to gain alms food, O Bhante, just stand
here. They will bring it for you just here.” Having said: “I am
not one [wishing] to gain alms food, O friend.” having turned back
from there, by which way [led to] Nigantha Nataputta, by that way he
approached. Having approached, he said this to Nigantha Nataputta: It is
only so true, O Bhante, in that Upali, head of household, has become a
disciple of the samana Gotama. Here I, O Bhante did not gain your [consent]
with this [objection]: “This is not pleasing to me, O Bhante, that Upali,
the head of household, would refute the samana Gotama's doctrine. Indeed, O
Bhante, the samana Gotamo is a magician. He knows a converting magic, with
which he converts the disciples of other standpoints.” “Upali,
head of household, O Bhante, has been converted by the samana Gotama, with
his converting magic.” “This is impossible, O Tapassi, there is
no chance, in that Upali, the head of household, might undertake
discipleship [under] the samana Gotama. But this possibility is to be found
in that the samana Gotama might undertake discipleship under Upali, the head
of household.” Also for a second time, Dighatapassi, the Nigantha
said this to Nigantha Nataputta: It is only so true, O Bhante, in that
Upali, head of household, has become a disciple of the samana Gotama. Here
I, O Bhante did not gain your [consent] with this [objection]: “This is
not pleasing to me, O Bhante, that Upali, the head of household, would
refute the samana Gotama's doctrine. Indeed, O Bhante, the samana Gotamo is
a magician. He knows a converting magic, with which he converts the
disciples of other standpoints.” “Upali, head of household, O
Bhante, has been converted by the samana Gotama, with his converting
magic.” “This is impossible, O Tapassi, there is no chance, in
that Upali, the head of household, might undertake discipleship [under] the
samana Gotama. But this possibility is to be found in that the samana Gotama
might undertake discipleship under Upali, the head of household.”
Also for a third time, Dighatapassi, the Nigantha said this to Nigantha
Nataputta: It is only so true, O Bhante, in that Upali, head of household,
has become a disciple of the samana Gotama. Here I, O Bhante did not gain
your [consent] with this [objection]: “This is not pleasing to me, O

“This is impossible, O Tapassi, there is no chance, in that Upali, the
head of household, might undertake discipleship [under] the samana
Gotama. But this possibility is to be found in that the samana Gotama might
undertake discipleship under Upali, the head of household.” Well
now, O Tapassi, I must go. I must find out for myself whether Upali, head of
household, has become a disciple of the samana Gotama or not.”

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
So then, which way [led to] Upali, head of household's house, by , by that
way Nigantha Nataputta approached with a large assembly of Niganthas. The
gatekeeper saw Nigantha Nataputta approaching from afar. Having seen, he
said this to Nigantha Nataputta: “Stand [here] O Bhante, do not
enter. From this day forth, Upali, head of household, has become the
disciple of the samana Gotama. He shuts his door to the Niganthas and
Niganthis. He opens his door to the Auspicious One's bhikkhus, bhikkhunis,
male lay disciples and female lay disciples. If you are one [wishing] to
gain alms food, O Bhante, just stand here. They will bring it for you just
here.” “Well now, good gate keeper, by which way [leads to]
Upali, head of household, by that way approached. Having approached, say
thus to Upali, head of household: “Venerable sir, Nigantha Nataputta is
standing outside the door at the gatehouse with a large assembly of
Niganthas. He wishes to see you.” “Yes, Bhante.” The
gatekeeper, having replied to Nigantha Nataputta, by which way [led to]
Upali, head of household, by that way he approached. Having approached, he
said this to Upali, head of household: “Venerable sir, Nigantha Nataputta
is standing outside the door at the gatehouse with a large assembly of
Niganthas. He wishes to see you.” Well then, good gate keeper,
prepare seats in the middle door hall.” “Yes, Bhante.”
The gatekeeper, having replied to Upali, head of household, having caused
seats to be prepared in the middle door hall, by which way [led to] Upali,
head of household, by that way he approached. Having approached, he said
this to Upali, head of household: “Seats have been prepared for you in
the middle door hall, O venerable sir. It is now time to do as you think
fit.”

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
So then, by which way [led to] the middle door hall, by that way Upali, head
of household, approached. Having approached, having sat down on the
foremost, the best, the highest, the most excellent seat in that place, he
address the gate keeper: Well now good gate keeper, by which way [leads to]
Nigantha Nataputta, by that way approach. Having approached, say thus to
Nigantha Nataputta: “Bhante, Upali, head of household, has said thus:
Enter now, Bhante, if you wish.” “Yes, Bhante.” The
gatekeeper, having replied to Upali, head of household, by which way [led
to] Nigantha Nataputta, by that way he approached. Having approached, he
said this to Nigantha Nataputta: “Bhante, Upali, head of household, has
said thus: Enter now, Bhante, if you wish.” So then, by which way
[led to] the middle door hall, by that way Nigantha Nataputta approached
with a large assembly of Niganthas. Formerly, from the time Upali, head of
household, sees Nigantha Nataputta approaching from afar, having gone out to
meet him from there, having dusted off the foremost, the best, the highest,
the most excellent seat in that place, having grapbbed it all around, offers
[for him] to sit down.[But] now, having sat down on the foremost, the best,
the highest, the most excellent seat in that place himself, he said this to
Nigantha Nataputta: “There are seats, O Bhante, sit down if you
wish.” When thus was said, Nigantha Nataputta said this to Upali,
head of household: “You, O head of household, are out of your
mind.” You, O head of household, are stupid.” “Having
gone [saying:] O Bhante, I must go. I will refute the samana Gotama's
doctrine on this point of dispute.” you have come back fastened to
the vast net of [his] doctrine. It is as if, O head of household, a
castrator, having gone to [castrate] a man, might come back with his
testicles removed. Moreover, it is as if, O head of household, an eye
plucker, having gone to [pluck out the eyes] of a man, might come back with
his eyes removed, It is just so, O head of household, having gone [saying:]
O Bhante, I must go. I will refute the samana Gotama's doctrine on this
point of dispute.” you have come back fastened to the vast net of
[his] doctrine. You have been converted, O head of household, by the samana
Gotama, with his converting magic.”

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
Auspicious, O Bhante, is the converting magic, excellent, O Bhante, is the
converting magic. Were my dear relations to be converted by this converting
magic, that will lead to the welfare and happiness of my dear relations for
a long time. O Bhante, even if all Khattiyas too would be converted by this
converting magic, that will be for the welfare and happiness of all
Khattiyas too for a long time. O Bhante, even if all Brahmans too would be
converted by this converting magic, that will be for the welfare and
happiness of all Brahmins too for a long time. O Bhante, even if all Vessas
too would be converted by this converting magic, that will be for the
welfare and happiness of all Vessas too for a long time. O Bhante, even if
all Suddas too would be converted by this converting magic, that will be for
the welfare and happiness of all Suddas too for a long time. O Bhante, even
if [all] the deva, mara and brahma worlds, together with the population of
samanas and brahmanas, devas and humans too would be converted by this
converting magic, that will be for the welfare and happiness of [all] the
deva, māra and brahma worlds, together with the population of samanas and
brahmanas, devas and humans too for a long time.

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
 Well then, O Bhante, I will make a simile for you. Some wise men here
understand the meaning of a statement by a simile. Once upon a time, O
Bhante, a certain aged Brahmin, old, an old man, [had a] young maiden, a
goddess of creation who came to be pregnant, nearing childbirth. Then, O
Bhante, that maiden said this to that Brahmin: “Go you Brahmin, to the
market and having bought a young monkey, bring it to me. It will be my
child's playmate.” When thus was said, O Bhante, the Brahmin said
this to that maiden: “Dear Madam, which [gender] you give birth, that
[gender of monkey] comes. If you, dear Madam, give birth to a boy, then I
will buy a young male monkey from the market and bring for you to be a
playmate for your child. However, if you, dear Madam, give birth to a girl,
then I will buy a young female monkey from the market and bring for you to
be a playmate for your child.” Also for a second time, O Bhante,
that maiden said this to that Brahmin: “Go you Brahmin, to the market and
having bought a young monkey, bring it to me. It will be my child's
playmate.” When thus was said, O Bhante, the Brahmin said this to
that maiden: “Dear Madam, which [gender] you give birth, that [gender of
monkey] comes. If you, dear Madam, give birth to a boy, then I will buy a
young male monkey from the market and bring for you to be a playmate for
your child. However, if you, dear Madam, give birth to a girl, then I will
buy a young female monkey from the market and bring for you to be a playmate
for your child.” Also for a third time, O Bhante, that maiden said
this to that Brahmin: “Go you Brahmin, to the market and having bought a
young monkey, bring it to me. It will be my child's playmate.” When
thus was said, O Bhante, the Brahmin said this to that maiden: “Dear
Madam, which [gender] you give birth, that [gender of monkey] comes. If you,
dear Madam, give birth to a boy, then I will buy a young male monkey from
the market and bring for you to be a playmate for your child. However, if
you, dear Madam, give birth to a girl, then I will buy a young female monkey
from the market and bring for you to be a playmate for your child.”
So then, O Bhante, that Brahmin being enamoured of that maiden, with his
mind bound to her, having bought a young monkey from the market, having
brought it, said this to the maiden: “Dear Madam, having bought this
young male monkey from the market, [I] bring for you to be a playmate for
your child.” When thus was said, O Bhante, that maiden said this to
that Brahmin: Go you Brahmin, having taken this young monkey, by which way
[leads to] Rattapani, the dyer's son, by that way you approach. Having
approached, say thus to Rattapani, the dyer's son: “Good Rattapani, I
wish this young monkey to be dyed the color called yellow-unguent, pressed
and repressed and smoothen on both sides.” So then, O Bhante, that
Brahmin being enamoured of that maiden, with his mind bound to her, having
taken that young monkey, by which way [led to] Rattapani, the dyer's son, by
that way he approached. Having approached, he said this to Rattapani, the
dyer's son: “Good Rattapani, I wish this young monkey to be dyed the
color called yellow-unguent, pressed and repressed and smoothened on both
sides.” When thus was said, O Bhante, Rattapani, the dyer's son,
said this to the Brahmin: “This young monkey, venerable sir, can indeed
withstand dyeing, [but] cannot withstand pressing and cannot withstand
smoothening. It is just so, O Bhante, the doctrine of the foolish Niganthas
is indeed a suitable stage for fools, [but] cannot withstand the inquiry of
the wise, and cannot withstand smoothening.” Then on another
occasion, O Bhante, that Brahmin, having taken a suit of new garments, by
which way [led to] Rattapani, the dyer's son, by that way he
approached. Having approached, he said this to Rattapani, the dyer's son:
“I wish this suit of new garments to be dyed the color called
yellow-unguent, pressed and repressed and smoothened on both
sides.” When thus was said, O Bhante, Rattapani, the dyer's son,
said this to the Brahmin: “This suit of new garments, venerable sir, can
indeed withstand dyeing, can withstand pressing and can withstand
smoothening. It is just so, O Bhante, the doctrine of the Auspicious One,
the Arahant, the rightly self-awakened One, is a suitable stage for only of
the wise, not of fools, and can withstand inquiry and can withstand
smoothening.”

<p><span class="parno">27</span>
This assembly, O head of household, including the king, knows thus:
“Upali, head of household, is a disciple of Nigantha Nataputta. Whose
disciple, O head of household, should we remember you as?”). When
thus was said, Upali, head of household, having risen up from his seat,
having arranged his outer robe on one shoulder, having joined his palms
together in anjali in the direction of the Auspicious One, said this to
Nigantha Nataputta: Well then, O Bhante, hear whose disciple I am:

“But when, O head of household, were these hymns of praise to the samana
Gotama composed by you?” “It is as if, O Bhante, there were a
great heap of flowers, of various flowers. By that a skilled florist or
florist apprentice might string together just a beautiful garland. It is
just so, O Bhante, the Auspicious One has many praises, many hundreds of
praises. Who indeed, O Bhante, will not praise the praiseworthy?”

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
“Then, for Nigantha not able to bear the honor of the Auspicious One, hot
blood gushed from his mouth just there.”
