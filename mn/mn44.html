dormant for pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to aversion lies
dormant for painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance lies
dormant for neither painful nor pleasant feeling.”

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
“Noble lady, does the underlying tendency to lust lie dormant for all

all painful feelings? Does the underlying tendency to ignorance lie dormant
for all neither painful nor pleasant feelings?” “Indeed friend
Visakha, the underlying tendency to lust does not lie dormant for all

for all painful feelings. The underlying tendency to ignorance does not lie
dormant for all neither painful nor pleasant feelings.”

<p><span class="parno">26</span>

“Noble lady, should the underlying tendency to lust be abandoned for all

friend Visakha, the underlying tendency to lust should not be abandoned for

abandoned for all painful feelings. The underlying tendency to ignorance
should not be abandoned for all neither painful nor pleasant feelings. Here
friend Visakha, quite secluded from sense-desires, secluded from unwholesome
dhammas, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the rapture and pleasure born
of seclusion connected with thinking and pondering, the first jhana, by
which he abandons lust. The underlying tendency to lust does not lie dormant
therein. Here friend Visakha, a bhikkhu considers thus: “O when indeed
will I enter upon and dwell in that domain, that which is the domain the
noble ones at present enter upon and dwell in?” Thus yearning for
the unsurpassed liberations, mental pain arises in dependence on arousing of
that yearning, by which he abandons aversion. The underlying tendency to

But noble lady, what is the counterpart of noble knowledge? Friend Visakha,
liberation is the counterpart of noble knowledge.

<p><span class="parno">33</span>
But noble lady, what is the counterpart of liberation? Friend Visakha,
nibbana is the counterpart of liberation.

<p><span class="parno">34</span>
But noble lady, what is the counterpart of nibbana? “Friend Visakha, you
have gone beyond questioning. You were unable to grasp the limits of
questions. Indeed friend Visakha, the life of purity plunges in nibbana, has
nibbana as its final end, nibbana as its conclusion.” But if you
wish, friend Visakha, having stopped by the Auspicious One, you may ask him
about the meaning of this. As the Auspicious One explains it, so should you
bear it in mind.

<p><span class="parno">35</span>
Then the lay disciple Visakha, having delighted [in] the bhikkhuni
Dhammadinna's words having rejoiced, having risen up from his seat, having
bowed down, having circumambulated the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna, visited with
the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, he bowed down to the Auspicious One and
sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the lay disciple Visakha
informed the Auspicious One of the friendly conversation he had with the
bhikkhuni Dhammadinna.

<p><span class="parno">36</span>
When thus was said, the Auspicious One said this to the lay disciple
Visakha: A wise one, O Visakha, is the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna. Of great
wisdom, O visākha, is the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna. And if you would have asked
me too, O Visakha, about the meaning of this, I too would have answered just
so, as that which the bhikkhuni dhammadinna have answered. This is just the
meaning of it, thus, should you remember this.

<p><span class="parno">37</span>
This is what the Auspicious One said. Delighted, the lay disciple Visakha
rejoiced in the Auspicious One's words.

But noble lady, what is the counterpart of ignorance? Friend Visakha, noble
knowledge is the counterpart of ignorance.

But noble lady, what is the counterpart of noble knowledge? Friend Visakha,
liberation is the counterpart of noble knowledge.

But noble lady, what is the counterpart of liberation? Friend Visakha,
nibbana is the counterpart of liberation.

<p><span class="parno">34</span>
But noble lady, what is the counterpart of nibbana? “Friend Visakha, you
have gone beyond questioning. You were unable to grasp the limits of
questions. Indeed friend Visakha, the life of purity plunges in nibbana, has
nibbana as its final end, nibbana as its conclusion.” But if you
wish, friend Visakha, having stopped by the Auspicious One, you may ask him
about the meaning of this. As the Auspicious One explains it, so should you
bear it in mind.

Then the lay disciple Visakha, having delighted [in] the bhikkhuni
Dhammadinna's words having rejoiced, having risen up from his seat, having
bowed down, having circumambulated the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna, visited with
the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, he bowed down to the Auspicious One and
sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the lay disciple Visakha
informed the Auspicious One of the friendly conversation he had with the
bhikkhuni Dhammadinna.

<p><span class="parno">36</span>
When thus was said, the Auspicious One said this to the lay disciple
Visakha: A wise one, O Visakha, is the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna. Of great
wisdom, O visākha, is the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna. And if you would have asked
me too, O Visakha, about the meaning of this, I too would have answered just
so, as that which the bhikkhuni dhammadinna have answered. This is just the
meaning of it, thus, should you remember this.

<p><span class="parno">37</span>
This is what the Auspicious One said. Delighted, the lay disciple Visakha
rejoiced in the Auspicious One's words.
