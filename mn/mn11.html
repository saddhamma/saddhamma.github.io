<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling in
Savatthi at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. At that place, the
Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus: Bhikkhus. “Bhante,” those
bhikkhus replied to the Auspicious One. The Auspicious One said this:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
O bhikkhus, “only here is there a samana, here a second samana, here a
third samana, here a fourth samana, other insignificant teachings of
outsiders are empty of samaṇas.” It is in this way, O bhikkhus,
that you should rightly roar your lion's roar. But this possibility, O
bhikkhus, is to be found, in that here, the wanderers of other standpoints
might say thus: But on what consolation of the venerable ones, by what power
do you venerables speak thus: “Only here is there a samana, here a second
samana, here a third samana, here a fourth samana, other insignificant
teachings of outsiders are empty of samaṇas?”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Thus, O bhikkhus, should be said to the wanderers of other standpoints who
may speak thus: There are, O friends, these four dhammas declared by the
Auspicious One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the rightly self-awakened
One. By us seeing that within ourselves, we say thus: “Only here is there
a samana, here a second samana, here a third samana, here a fourth samana,
other insignificant teachings of outsiders are empty of samaṇas.”
Which four? O friends, for us there is faith in the Teacher. There is faith
in the Dhamma. There is completeness in the virtues. Our Dhamma companions
are ever so dear and pleasing, both householders and ones gone forth. These,
O friends, are the four dhammas declared by the Auspicious One who knows and
sees, the Arahant, the rightly self-awakened One. By us seeing that within
ourselves, we say thus: “Only here is there a samana, here a second
samana, here a third samana, here a fourth samana, other insignificant
teachings of outsiders are empty of samaṇas.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
But this possibility, O bhikkhus, is to be found, in that the wanderers of
other standpoints might say thus: “For us too, O friends, there is faith
in the teacher, our teacher. For us too there is faith in the dhamma, our
dhamma. We too are ones who are complete in the virtues, our virtues. For us
too, our dhamma companions are dear and pleasing, both householders and ones
gone forth. Here, O friends, of these, what is the distinction? What is the
disparity, what is the difference, that is, [between] yours and
ours?”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Thus, O bhikkhus, should be said to the wanderers of other standpoints who
may speak thus: “But, O friends, what is the end goal, unique or
diverse?” Rightly answering, O bhikkhus, the wanderers of other
standpoints would answer thus: Indeed, O friends, the end goal is
unique. The end goal is not diverse.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
“But, O friends, is the end goal for one with lust, or for one free from
lust?” Rightly answering, O bhikkhus, the wanderers of other
standpoints would answer thus: The end goal, O friends, is for one who is
free from lust. The end goal is not for one with lust.”

“But, O friends, is the end goal for one with hate, or for one free from
hate?” Rightly answering, O bhikkhus, the wanderers of other
standpoints would answer thus: The end goal, O friends, is for one who is
free from hate. The end goal is not for one with hate.”

“But, O friends, is the end goal for one with delusion, or for one free
from delusion?” Rightly answering, O bhikkhus, the wanderers of
other standpoints would answer thus: The end goal, O friends, is for one who
is free from delusion. The end goal is not for one with delusion.”

“But, O friends, is the end goal for one with thirsting, or for one free
from thirsting?” Rightly answering, O bhikkhus, the wanderers of
other standpoints would answer thus: The end goal, O friends, is for one who
is free from thirsting. The end goal is not for one with
thirsting.”

“But, O friends, is the end goal for one with undertakings, or for one
free from undertakings?” Rightly answering, O bhikkhus, the
wanderers of other standpoints would answer thus: The end goal, O friends,
is for one who is free from undertakings. The end goal is not for one with
undertakings.”

“But, O friends, is the end goal for one with vision, or for one without
vision?” Rightly answering, O bhikkhus, the wanderers of other
standpoints would answer thus: The end goal, O friends, is for one with
vision. The end goal is not for one without vision.”

“But, O friends, is the end goal for one who affirms and negates, or for
one who does not affirm and negate?” Rightly answering, O bhikkhus,
the wanderers of other standpoints would answer thus: The end goal, O
friends, is for one who does not affirm and negate. The end goal is not for
one who affirms and negates.”

“But, O friends, is the end goal for one who enjoys papanca and delights
in papanca, or for one who does not enjoy papanca and delight in
papanca?” Rightly answering, O bhikkhus, the wanderers of other
standpoints would answer thus: The end goal, O friends, is for one who does
not enjoy papanca and delight in papanca. The end goal is not for one who
enjoys papanca and delights in papanca.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, these two views, the view of being and the view of
non-being. Indeed, O bhikkhus, those samanas or brahmanas who stick to the
view of being, have entered upon the view of being, are attached to the view
of being, negate those with the view of non-being. Indeed, O bhikkhus, those
samanas or brahmanas who stick to the view of non-being, have entered upon
the view of non-being, are attached to the view of non-being, negate those
with the view of being. Indeed, O bhikkhus, those samanas or brahmanas who
are of these two views, do not wisely understand as it has come to be the
arising, the extinction, the gratification, the liability and the stepping
out of the six [sense] domain for contact. They are those with lust, those
with hate, those with delusion, those with thirsting, those with
undertakings, those without vision, those who affirm and negate, those who
delight in papanca. They are not released from birth, old age, death,
sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental suffering and despair. They
are not released from suffering, I say.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
But O bhikkhus, those samanas or brahmanas who wisely understand as it has
come to be the arising, the extinction, the gratification, the liability and
the stepping out of these two views, they are those who are free from lust,
those who are free from hate, those who are free from delusion, those who
are free from thirsting, those who are without undertakings, those who are
with vision, those who do not affirm and negate, those who do not enjoy
papanca and delight in papanca. They are released from birth, old age,
death, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental suffering and
despair. They are released from suffering, I say.

There are, O bhikkhus, these four undertakings. Which four? The undertaking
of sensual pleasures, the undertaking of views, the undertaking of virtue
and [religious] duties, the undertaking of the doctrine of self. There are,
O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas who, while acknowledging to teach the
comprehensive knowledge of all undertakings, do not rightly declare the
comprehensive knowledge of all undertakings. They declare the comprehensive
knowledge of the undertaking of sensual pleasures, [but] they do not declare
the comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of views, [and] they do not
declare the comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of virtue and
[religious] duties, [and] they do not declare the comprehensive knowledge of
the undertaking of the doctrine of self. What is the reason for that?
Because those honorable samanas and brahmanas do not wisely understand these
three grounds as they have come to be. Therefore, those honorable samanas
and brahmanas who, while acknowledging to teach the comprehensive knowledge
of all undertakings, do not rightly declare the comprehensive knowledge of
all undertakings. They declare the comprehensive knowledge of the
undertaking of sensual pleasures, [but] they do not declare the
comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of views, [and] they do not
declare the comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of virtue and
[religious] duties, [and] they do not declare the comprehensive knowledge of
the undertaking of the doctrine of self.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>

to teach the comprehensive knowledge of all undertakings, do not rightly
declare the comprehensive knowledge of all undertakings. They declare the
comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of sensual pleasures, [and] they
declare the comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of views, [but] they
do not declare the comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of virtue and
[religious] duties, [and] they do not declare the comprehensive knowledge of
the undertaking of the doctrine of self. What is the reason for that?

undertakings. They declare the comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of

undertaking of views, [but] they do not declare the comprehensive knowledge
of the undertaking of virtue and [religious] duties, [and] they do not
declare the comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of the doctrine of
self.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas who, while acknowledging
to teach the comprehensive knowledge of all undertakings, do not rightly
declare the comprehensive knowledge of all undertakings. They declare the
comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of sensual pleasures, [and] they
declare the comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of views, [and] they
declare the comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of virtue and
[religious] duties, [but] they do not declare the comprehensive knowledge of
the undertaking of the doctrine of self. What is the reason for that?
Because those honorable samanas and brahmanas do not wisely understand this
one ground as it has come to be. Therefore, those honorable samanas and
brahmanas who, while acknowledging to teach the comprehensive knowledge of
all undertakings, do not rightly declare the comprehensive knowledge of all
undertakings. They declare the comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of
sensual pleasures, [and] they declare the comprehensive knowledge of the
undertaking of views, [and] they declare the comprehensive knowledge of the
undertaking of virtue and [religious] duties, [but] they do not declare the
comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of the doctrine of self.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
O bhikkhus, in such a form of dhamma and discipline, he who has faith in the
teacher, his [faith] is declared to be not rightly placed; he who has faith
in the dhamma, his [faith] is declared to be not rightly placed; he who is
complete in the virtues, his [completeness in the virtues] is declared to be
not rightly placed; he whose dhamma companions are dear and pleasing, his
[companionship] is declared to be not rightly placed. What is the reason for
that? Because, this is just so, O bhikkhus, as happens when the dhamma and
discipline are badly proclaimed, badly declared, not leading to
emancipation, not conducive to calm, proclaimed by one who is not rightly
self-awakened.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
But the Tathagata, O bhikkhus, the Arahant, the rightly self-awakened One,
while acknowledging to teach the comprehensive knowledge of all
undertakings, rightly declares the comprehensive knowledge of all
undertakings. He declares the comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of
sensual pleasures, [and] he declares the comprehensive knowledge of the
undertaking of views, [and] he declares the comprehensive knowledge of the
undertaking of virtue and [religious] duties, [and] he declares the
comprehensive knowledge of the undertaking of the doctrine of self.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
O bhikkhus, in such a form of dhamma and discipline, he who has faith in the
Teacher, his [faith] is declared to be rightly placed; he who has faith in
the Dhamma, his [faith] is declared to be rightly placed; he who is complete
in the virtues, his [completeness in the virtues] is declared to be rightly
placed; he whose Dhamma companions are dear and pleasing, his
[companionship] is declared to be rightly placed. What is the reason for
that? Because, this is just so, O bhikkhus, as happens when the dhamma and
discipline are well proclaimed, well declared, leading to emancipation,
conducive to calm, proclaimed by one who is rightly self-awakened.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
But these four undertakings, O bhikkhus, what is their source? What is their
origin? From what are they born? From what do they arise? These four
undertakings have thirsting as their source, thirsting as their origin, they
are born from thirsting, arise from thirsting. And this thirsting, O
bhikkhus, what is its source? What is its origin? From what is it born? From
what does it arise? thirsting has feeling as its source, feeling as its
origin, it is born from feeling, arise from feeling. And this feeling, O
bhikkhus, what is its source? What is its origin? From what is it born? From
what does it arise? Feeling has contact as its source, contact as its
origin, it is born from contact, arise from contact. And this contact, O
bhikkhus, what is its source? What is its origin? From what is it born? From
what does it arise? Contact has the six [sense] domain as its source, the
six [sense] domain as its origin, it is born from the six [sense] domain,
arise from the six [sense] domain. And this six [sense] domain, O bhikkhus,
what is its source? What is its origin? From what is it born? From what does
it arise? The six [sense] domain has name and form as its source, name and
form as its origin, it is born from name and form, arise from name and
form. And this name and form, O bhikkhus, what is its source? What is its
origin? From what is it born? From what does it arise? Name and form has
consciousness as its source, consciousness as its origin, it is born from
consciousness, arise from consciousness. And this consciousness, O bhikkhus,
what is its source? What is its origin? From what is it born? From what does
it arise? Consciousness has sankharas as its source, sankharas as its
origin, it is born from sankharas, arise from sankharas. And these
sankharas, O bhikkhus, what is their source? What is their origin? From what
are they born? From what do they arise? These sankharas have ignorance as
their source, ignorance as their origin, they are born from ignorance, arise
from ignorance.

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
But from the time, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's ignorance have been abandoned and
noble knowledge has arisen, from the fading away of ignorance, from the
arising of noble knowledge, he neither undertakes the undertaking of sensual
pleasures, nor undertakes the undertaking of views, nor undertakes the
undertaking of virtue and [religious] duties, nor undertakes the undertaking
of the doctrine of self. Not undertaking, he is not perturbed. Not
perturbed, he definately attains parinibbana by himself. He wisely
understands: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity, done is
what had to be done, there is nothing further [to do] for
thusness.”

This is what the Auspicious One said. Delighted, those bhikkhus rejoiced in
the Auspicious One's words.
