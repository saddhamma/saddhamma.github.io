Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was wandering on tour
in Kasi with a large Sangha of bhikkhus. There, the Auspicious One did
address the bhikkhus: O bhikkhus, I only eat apart from evening meals. But
I, O bhikkhus, eating apart from evening meals, do perceive that little
affliction and that little illness, a lightness and strength and a
comfortable abiding. “Come you, O bhikkhus, you too must eat only apart
from evening meals. You too, O bhikkhus, eating apart from evening meals,
you will nevertheless perceive that little affliction and that little
illness, a lightness and strength and a comfortable
abiding”. “Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied to the
Auspicious One. Later on, the Auspicious One, wandering on tour by stages in
Kasi, arrived at that market town of Kasi named Kitagiri. There the
Auspicious One abided in the market town of Kasi at Kitagiri.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
At that time the bhikkhus named Assaji and Punabbasuka were residents of
Kitagiri. So then, many bhikkhus visited with Assaji and Punabbasuka. Upon
arrival, the bhikkhus said this to Assaji and Punabbasuka: “The
Auspicious One, friends, and the bhikkhu Sangha only eat apart from evening
meals. Nevertheless, friends, eating apart from evening meals, they perceive
that little affliction and that little illness, a lightness and strength and
a comfortable abiding.” “Come you, friends, you too must only
eat apart from evening meals. Eating apart from evening meals, friends, you
too will nevertheless perceive that little affliction and that little
illness, a lightness and strength and a comfortable abiding”. When
thus was said, the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka said this to those
bhikkhus: “We, friends, just eat in the evening, morning and during the
day at the wrong time. Just eating in the evening, morning and during the
day at the wrong time, we perceive that little affliction and that little
illness, a lightness and strength and a comfortable abiding. Why should we,
having abandoned that which is visible here and now, run after what takes
time?” “We will eat only in the evening, morning and during the
day at the wrong time”. Since those bhikkhus were unable to
convince the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka, they went to the Auspicious
One. Upon arrival, they bowed down to the Auspicious One and sat down to one
side. Having sat on one side, those bhikkhus said this to the Auspicious
One.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Here Bhante, we visited with the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka. Upon
arrival, we said this to the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka: “The
Auspicious One and the bhikkhu Sangha, friends, only eat apart from evening
meals. Eating apart from evening meals, friends, they nevertheless perceive
that little affliction and that little illness, lightness and strength and a
comfortable abiding. Come you, friends, you too  must only eat apart from
evening meals. Eating apart from evening meals friends, you too will
nevertheless perceive that little affliction and that little illness, a
lightness and strength and a comfortable abiding”. When thus was
said, Bhante, the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka said this to us: “We,
friends, just eat in the evening, morning and during the day at the wrong
time. We, just eating in the evening, morning and during the day at the
wrong time, we perceive that little affliction and that little illness, a
lightness and strength and a comfortable abiding. Why, having abandoned that
which is visible here and now, should we run after what takes time? We will
eat just in the evening, morning and during the day at the wrong
time”. “Since we, Bhante, were unable to convince the bhikkhus
Assaji and Punabbasuka, we inform this matter to the Auspicious
One”.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
So then, the Auspicious One addressed a certain bhikkhu: “Come you
bhikkhu. Addressed the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka in my name that the
Teacher summons the venerables”. “Yes, Bhante”. That
bhikkhu, having replied to the Auspicious One, went to the bhikkhus Assaji
and Punabbasuka. Upon arrival, he said this to the bhikkhus Assaji and
Punabbasuka: “The Teacher summons the venerables”. “Yes,
friend”. The bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka, having replied to
that bhikkhu, they went to the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, they bowed to
the Auspicious One and sat down to one side. Having sat to one side, the
Auspicious One said this to the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“Is it true as reported, O bhikkhus, that many bhikkhus, having visited
with you, said this: “The Auspicious One and the bhikkhu Sangha, friends,
only eat apart from evening meals. Eating apart from evening meals, friends,
they nevertheless perceive that little affliction and that little illness, a
lightness and strength and a comfortable abiding. Come you, friends, you too
must only eat apart from evening meals. Eating apart from evening meals,
friends, you too will nevertheless perceive that little affliction and that
little illness, a lightness and strength and a comfortable
abiding.” When thus was said, O bhikkhus, apparently you said to
those bhikkhus: “We, friends, just eat in the evening, morning and during
the day at the wrong time. Eating just in the evening, morning and during
the day at the wrong time, we perceive that little affliction and that
little illness, a lightness and strength and a comfortable abiding. Why
should we, having abandoned that which is visible here and now, run after
what takes time. We will just eat in the evening, morning and during the day
at the wrong time.”” “Yes, Bhante.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Have you, O bhikkhus, known the dhamma taught by me to you thus:
“Whatever this individual person experiences, whether pleasure or pain or
neither pain nor pleasure, of that, unwholesome dhammas diminish, wholesome
dhammas increase.” “Certainly not, Bhante.” Have you
not, O bhikkhus, known the dhamma taught by me to you thus: “Here, of one
experiencing such a form of a pleasant feeling, unwholesome dhammas
increase, wholesome dhammas diminish. But here, of one experiencing such a
form of pleasant feeling, unwholesome dhammas diminish, wholesome dhammas
increase. Here, of one experiencing such a form of painful feeling,
unwholesome dhammas increase, wholesome dhammas diminish. But here, of one
experiencing such a form of painful feeling, unwholesome dhammas diminish,
wholesome dhammas increase. Here, of one experiencing such a form of neither
painful nor pleasant feeling, unwholesome dhammas increase, wholesome
dhammas diminish. But here, of one experiencing such a form of neither
painful nor pleasant feeling, unwholesome dhammas diminish, wholesome
dhammas increase.” “Yes, Bhante.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Good, O bhikkhus. “If that, O bhikkhus, would have been not understood,
unseen, unknown, unrealized, untouched with wisdom by me: “Here, of one
experiencing such a form of pleasant feeling, unwholesome dhammas increase,
wholesome dhammas diminish.” I, O bhikkhus, not knowing thus,
should say “all of you, abandon such a form of pleasant feeling, would
this have been appropriate of me?”. “Certainly not,
Bhante.” But because, O bhikkhus, this is ever understood, seen,
known, realized, touched with wisdom by me, “here, of one experiencing
such a form of pleasant feeling, unwholesome dhammas increase, wholesome
dhammas diminish”. Therefore I say: “all of you, abandon such a
form of pleasant feeling.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
“If that, O bhikkhus,  would have been not understood, unseen, unknown,
unrealized, untouched with wisdom by me: “Here, of one experiencing such
a form of pleasant feeling, unwholesome dhammas diminish, wholesome dhammas
increase.” I, not knowing thus should say, “all of you, enter
upon and abide in such a form of pleasant feeling. Would this too, O
bhikkhus, have been appropriate of me? “Certainly not, Bhante.”
“But because this, O bhikkhus, is ever understood, seen, known, realized,
touched with wisdom by me: “here, of one experiencing such a form of
pleasant feeling, unwholesome dhammas diminish, wholesome dhammas
increase. Therefore I say, all of you, enter upon and abide in such a form
of pleasant feeling.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
If that, O bhikkhus, would have been not understood, unseen, unknown,
unrealized, untouched with wisdom by me: “Here, of one experiencing such
a form of painful feeling, unwholesome dhammas increase, wholesome dhammas
diminish.” I, not knowing thus should say “all of you, abandon
such a form of painful feeling. Would this too, O bhikkhus, have been
appropriate of me?” “Certainly not, Bhante.” “But
because, O bhikkhus, this is ever understood, seen, known, realized, touched
with wisdom by me: “Here, of one experiencing such a form of painful
feeling, unwholesome dhammas increase, wholesome dhammas diminish.”
Therefore I say, all of you, abandon such a form of painful feeling.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
If that, O bhikkhus, would have been not understood, unseen, unknown,
unrealized, untouched with wisdom by me: “Here, of one experiencing such
a form of painful feeling, unwholesome dhammas diminish, wholesome dhammas
increase.” I, not knowing thus should say “all of you, enter
upon and abide in such a form of painful feeling. “Would this too, O
bhikkhus, have been appropriate of me?” “Certainly not,
Bhante.” “But because, O bhikkhus, this is ever understood,
seen, known, realized, touched with wisdom by me: “Here, of one
experiencing such a form of painful feeling, unwholesome dhammas diminish,
wholesome dhammas increase.” Therefore I say, all of you, enter
upon and abide in such a form of painful feeling.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
If that, O bhikkhus, would have been not understood, unseen, unknown,
unrealized, untouched with wisdom by me: “Here, of one experiencing such
a form of neither painful nor pleasant feeling, unwholesome dhammas
increase, wholesome dhammas diminish.” I, not knowing thus should
say “all of you, abandon such a form of neither painful nor pleasant
feeling. “would this too, O bhikkhus, have been appropriate of
me?” Certainly not, Bhante. “But because, O bhikkhus, this is
ever understood, seen, known, realized, touched with wisdom by me: “Here,
of one experiencing such a form of neither painful nor pleasant feeling,
unwholesome dhammas increase, wholesome dhammas diminish.”
Therefore I say, all of you, abandon such a form of neither painful nor
pleasant feeling.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
“If that, O bhikkhus, would have been not understood, unseen, unknown,
unrealized, untouched with wisdom by me: “Here, of one experiencing such
a form of neither painful nor pleasant feeling, unwholesome dhammas
diminish, wholesome dhammas increase.” I, not knowing thus should
say “all of you, enter upon and abide in such a form of neither painful
nor pleasant feeling. “would this too, O bhikkhus, have been appropriate
of me”. “Certainly not, Bhante.” “But because, O
bhikkhus, this is ever understood, seen, known, realized, touched with
wisdom by me: “Here, of one experiencing such a form of neither painful
nor pleasant feeling, unwholesome dhammas diminish, wholesome dhammas
increase.” Therefore I say all of you, enter upon and abide in such
a form of neither painful nor pleasant feeling”.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
I do not say, O bhikkhus, of all bhikkhus that what must be done should be
done with vigilance. But [by] that I do not say, O bhikkhus, of all bhikkhus
that what must be done should not be done with vigilance. Those bhikkhus, O
bhikkhus, who are arahant with asavas destroyed, who have lived [the life of
purity], done what must be done, laid down the burden, attained the true
advantage, completely destroyed the fetters of being, and liberated by
correct final knowledge, such a form of bhikkhu, O bhikkhus, I do not say
that what must be done should be done with vigilance. What is the reason for
that?: They have done what must be done with vigilance. They are unable to
become negligent.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
But those bhikkhus, O bhikkhus, who are in higher training, of unattained
minds, they dwell ever aspiring for the unsurpassed security from
bondage. such a form of bhikkhu, O bhikkhus, I say that what must be done
should be done with vigilance. What is the reason for that? Indeed it is
well if these venerables are making use of suitable lodgings, resorting to
noble friends, leveling the differences in the faculties, [then] they may
dwell having entered upon that unsurpassed consummation of the life of
purity for the sake of which sons of clansmen just rightly go forth from the
household life into homelessness, having realized it with his own higher
knowledge in just this very life. Considering this fruit of vigilance, O
bhikkhus, I ever say of these bhikkhus that what must be done should be done
with vigilance.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, these seven individuals to be found existing in the
world. Which seven? Both ends liberated, wisdom liberated, body witness,
view attainer, faith liberated, dhamma follower, faith follower.

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
And who, O bhikkhus, is the both ends liberated individual? Here, O bhikkhus
a certain individual is one who having contact with the body, abides in
those peaceful liberations that are formless, surpassing forms, and having
seen with wisdom, his asavas come to be utterly destroyed. This is called, O
bhikkhus, both ends liberated individual. I, O bhikkhus, do not ever say of
this bhikkhu that what must be done should be done with vigilance. What is
the reason for that? He has done [what must be done] with vigilance. He is
unable to [become] negligent.

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
And who, O bhikkhus, is the wisdom liberated individual? Here, O bhikkhus, a
certain individual is one who does not contact with the body and abides in
those peaceful liberations that are formless, surpassing forms. But having
seen with wisdom, his asavas come to be utterly destroyed. This is called, O
bhikkhus, wisdom liberated individual. I, O bhikkhus, do not ever say of
this bhikkhu that what must be done should be done with vigilance. What is
the reason for that? He has done [what must be done] with vigilance. He is
unable to [become] negligent.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
And who, O bhikkhus, is the body witness individual? Here, O bhikkhus a
certain individual is one who having contact with the body, abides in those
peaceful liberations that are formless, surpassing forms, and having seen
with wisdom, some of his asavas come to be utterly destroyed. This is
called, O bhikkhus, body witness individual. I ever say, O bhikkhus, of this
bhikkhu that what must be done should be done with vigilance. What is the
reason for that? Indeed it is well if this venerable is making use of
suitable lodgings, resorting to noble friends, leveling the differences in
the faculties, [then] he may dwell having entered upon that unsurpassed
consummation of the life of purity for the sake of which sons of clansmen
just rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, having
realized it with his own higher knowledge in just this very
life. Considering this fruit of vigilance, O bhikkhus, I ever say of this
bhikkhu that what must be done should be done with vigilance.

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
And who, O bhikkhus, is the view attainer individual? Here, O bhikkhus, a
certain individual is one who does not contact with the body and abides in
those peaceful liberations that are formless, surpassing forms. But having
seen with wisdom, some of his asavas come to be utterly destroyed, and he
has fully understood and penetrated the teachings proclaimed by the
Tathagata with wisdom. This is called, O bhikkhus, the view attainer
individual. I ever say, O bhikkhus, of this bhikkhu that what must be done
should be done with vigilance. What is the reason for that? Indeed it is
well if this venerable is making use of suitable lodgings, resorting to
noble friends, leveling the differences in the faculties, [then] he may
dwell having entered upon that unsurpassed consummation of the life of
purity for the sake of which sons of clansmen just rightly go forth from the
household life into homelessness, having realized it with his own higher
knowledge in just this very life. Considering this fruit of vigilance, O
bhikkhus, I ever say of this bhikkhu that what must be done should be done
with vigilance.

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
And who, O bhikkhus, is the faith liberated individual? Here, O bhikkhus, a
certain individual is one who does not contact with the body and abides in
those peaceful liberations that are formless, surpassing forms. But having
seen with wisdom, some of his asavas come to be utterly destroyed, and his
faith in the Tathagata comes to be settled, rooted, established. This is
called, O bhikkhus, the faith liberated individual. I ever say, O bhikkhus,
of this bhikkhu that what must be done should be done with vigilance. What
is the reason for that? Indeed it is well if this venerable is making use of
suitable lodgings, resorting to noble friends, leveling the differences in
the faculties, [then] he may dwell having entered upon that unsurpassed
consummation of the life of purity for the sake of which sons of clansmen
just rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, having
realized it with his own higher knowledge in just this very
life. Considering this fruit of vigilance, O bhikkhus, I ever say of this
bhikkhu that what must be done should be done with vigilance.

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
And who, O bhikkhus, is the dhamma follower individual? Here, O bhikkhus, a
certain individual is one who does not contact with the body and abides in
those peaceful liberations that are formless, surpassing forms. And not
having seen with wisdom, some of his asavas are not utterly destroyed. But
he has a measure of understanding with wisdom and approves of the teachings
proclaimed by the Tathagata. And for him, these dhammas too come to be. That
is: the faith faculty, the energy faculty, the mindfulness faculty, the
samadhi faculty, the wisdom faculty. This is called, O bhikkhus, the dhamma
follower individual. I ever say, O bhikkhus, of this bhikkhu that what must
be done should be done with vigilance. What is the reason for that? Indeed
it is well if this venerable is making use of suitable lodgings, resorting
to noble friends, leveling the differences in the faculties, [then] he may
dwell having entered upon that unsurpassed consummation of the life of
purity for the sake of which sons of clansmen just rightly go forth from the
household life into homelessness, having realized it with his own higher
knowledge in just this very life. Considering this fruit of vigilance, O
bhikkhus, I ever say of this bhikkhu that what must be done should be done
with vigilance.

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
And who, O bhikkhus, is the faith follower individual? Here, O bhikkhus, a
certain individual is one who does not contact with the body and abides in
those peaceful liberations that are formless, surpassing forms. And not
having seen with wisdom, some of his asavas are not utterly destroyed. But
he has a measure of faith in the Tathagata and a measure of affection. And
for him, these dhammas too come to be. That is: the faith faculty, the
energy faculty, the mindfulness faculty, the samadhi faculty, the wisdom
faculty. This is called, O bhikkhus, the dhamma follower individual. I ever
say, O bhikkhus, of this bhikkhu that what must be done should be done with
vigilance. What is the reason for that? Indeed it is well if this venerable
is making use of suitable lodgings, resorting to noble friends, leveling the
differences in the faculties, [then] he may dwell having entered upon that
unsurpassed consummation of the life of purity for the sake of which sons of
clansmen just rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness,
having realized it with his own higher knowledge in just this very
life. Considering this fruit of vigilance, O bhikkhus, I ever say of this
bhikkhu that what must be done should be done with vigilance.

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
I, O bhikkhus, do not say that success in final knowledge comes to be all at
once. But, O bhikkhus, from gradual training, gradual practice and gradual
progress, success in final knowledge comes to be.

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
And how is it, O bhikkhus, that from gradual training, gradual practice and
gradual progress, success in final knowledge comes to be? Here, O bhikkhus,
faith having come into being, one visits with [the Teacher]; having visited,
one pays respects; having paid respects, one lends an ear; having lended an
ear, one listens to the Dhamma; having listened to the Dhamma, one bears it
in mind; having bore it in mind, one investigates the meaning of the Dhamma;
having investigated the meaning, one approves of the Dhamma; having approved
of the Dhamma with mindfulness, desire is born; with the birth of desire,
[one braces oneself for the] endurance [required]; having braced oneself,
one measures up the effort required; having measured up the effort, one
strives; resolutely striving, one realizes the highest truth by the body and
sees it having penetrated it with wisdom.

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
Indeed, O bhikkhus, that faith has not come to be. Indeed that visiting, O
bhikkhus has also not come to be. Indeed, that paying respects, O bhikkhus,
has also not come to be. Indeed, that lending an ear, O bhikkhus, has also
not come to be. Indeed, that hearing the dhamma, O bhikkhus, has also not
come to be. Indeed, that bearing the dhamma in mind, O bhikkhus, has also
not come to be. Indeed, that investigation of the meaning, O bhikkhus, has
also not come to be. Indeed, that approval of the dhamma, O bhikkhus, has
also not come to be. Indeed, that desire, O bhikkhus, has also not come to
be. Indeed, that endurance, O bhikkhus, has also not come to be. Indeed,
that measuring up effort, O bhikkhus, has also not come to be. Indeed, that
striving, O bhikkhus, has also not come to be. “You, O bhikkhus, have not
entered upon the path.” You, O bhikkhus, have entered upon a
mistaken path”. How far, O bhikkhus have these worthless men
strayed from this dhamma and discipline,

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
There is, O bhikkhus, a four-phrased exposition of which, having recited,
wise man could in no long [time] understand the meaning with wisdom. I will
recite it to you, O Bhikkhus. You must [try to] understand this by
me. “But Bhante, who are we to possess understanding of the
Dhamma”. O Bhikkhus, for a Teacher so interested in sensual things,
an inheritor of sensual things, abides associated with sensual things,
abounding of them such a form of haggling is not proper. “If thus suits
us, then we would do that. If thus does not suit us, then we would not do
that”. What then, O bhikkhus, about the Tathagata who abides
dissociated from all sensual things. For a faithful disciple, O bhikkhus,
engaged in assimilating the Teacher's dispensation, this is what accords
with the dhamma: “The Auspicious One is the Teacher, I am a
disciple.” “The Auspicious One knows, I do not know.“ For a
faithful disciple, O bhikkhus, engaged in assimilating the Teacher's
dispensation, the Teacher's dispensation is refreshing and nourishing. For a
faithful disciple, O bhikkhus, engaged in assimilating the Teacher's
dispensation, this is what accords with the dhamma: “truly let flesh and
blood dry up in the body, and my skin and senews and bones be left
