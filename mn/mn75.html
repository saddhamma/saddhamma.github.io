Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One dwelled among the Kurus
at a market town of the Kurus named Kammassadamma in a brahmin of the
bharadvaja clan's grass hut where fire is kept. Then in the morning time,
the Auspicious One, having dressed, having taken bowl and robes, entered
Kammassadamma for alms food. Having wandered in Kammassadamma for alms food,
after his meal, having gone back after alms gathering, he stopped by a
certain jungle thicket for the daytime abiding. Having plunged into that
jungle thicket, he sat down at a certain root of a tree for the daytime
abiding.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Now Magandiya, the wanderer, who was walking and wandering about, walking
along back and forth, stopped by the brahmin of the bharadvaja clan's grass
hut where fire is kept. Magandiya, the wanderer, saw the brahmin of the
bharadvaja clan's grass hut where fire is kept prepared. Having seen, he
said this to the brahmin of the bharadvaja clan: “For whom is this master
Bharadvaja's grass hut where fire is keptprepared. It causes me to think
about a form of samana's bed.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“Master Magandiya, there is the samana Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who
has gone forth from the Sakyan clan. Now a good reputation has been spread
about that Auspicious Gotama thus: “Truly is he the Auspicious One, the
Arahant, rightly self-awakened, excelling in knowledge and conduct,
well-farer, knower of worlds, incomparable charioteer of tamed persons,
teacher of devas and humans, awakened, auspicious.” The bed has
been prepared for that master Gotama.” “It is an ill-sight
indeed, master Bharadvaja, we who see the sight of the bed of that master
Gotama, the destroyer of beings.” “Guard that speech
Magandiya. Guard that speech Magandiya. Indeed many of master Gotama's wise
Khattiyas, wise Brahmans too, wise heads of household too, wise samanas too,
having gained the higher faith, are trained in the noble know-how, in the
Dhamma that is wholesome.” “O Bharadvaja, even if we were to see
that Auspicious Gotama face to face, we would say in his face too, “the
samana Gotama is a destroyer of beings.” What is the reason for
that? Because it is so, as handed down in our scriptures.” “If
it is not troublesome for master Magandiya, may I announce this to the
samana Gotama?” “Be at ease, master Bharadvaja, you may say to
him just what is said.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
With the purified divine ear element which surpasses that of humans, the
Auspicious One heard this friendly conversation between the brahmin of the
bharadvaja clan and Magandiya the wanderer. Then in the evening time,
[having] emerged from seclusion, the Auspicious One went to the brahmin of
the bharadvaja clan's grass hut where fire is kept. Upon arrival, he sat
down on the prepared [bed] made of grass. So then, the brahmin of the
bharadvaja clan went to the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, he exchanged
friendly greetings with the Auspicious One. Having exchanged friendly
greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side. Having sat down to one
side, the Auspicious One said this to the brahmin of the bharadvaja clan:
“Now for you, O bhāradvāja, was there any friendly conversation with
Magandiya, the wanderer, regarding just this [bed] made of grass?”
When thus was said, the brahmin of the bharadvaja clan, moved by fear, with
hairs standing on end, said this to the Auspicious One: “We ever so
desired to inform just this to master Gotama, but now the good Gotama has
just declared the yet-to-be-declared.” But this talk between the
Auspicious One and the brahmin of the bharadvaja clan was left unfinished
[for] then, Magandiya, the wanderer, who was walking and wandering about,
walking along back and forth, stopped by the brahmin of the bharadvaja
clan's grass hut where fire is kept. Upon arrival, he exchanged friendly
greetings with the Auspicious One. Having exchanged friendly greetings and
cordial talk, he sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the
Auspicious One said this to Magandiya, the wanderer: That eye, O Magandiya,
which enjoys forms, delights in forms, rejoices in forms, has been tamed for
the Tathagata, protected, guarded, restrained, and he teaches the Dhamma for
their restraint. For you, O māgandiya, was it with reference to this that
this was said: “The samana Gotama is a destroyer of beings.” It
was with reference to just this, master Gotama, that this was said: “The
samana Gotama is a destroyer of beings.” “What is the reason for
that? Because it is so, as handed down in our scriptures.”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
That ear, O Magandiya, which enjoys sounds, delights in sounds, rejoices in
sounds, has been tamed for the Tathagata, protected, guarded, restrained,
and he teaches the Dhamma for their restraint. For you, O māgandiya, was it
with reference to this that this was said: “The samana Gotama is a
destroyer of beings.” It was with reference to just this, master
Gotama, that this was said: “The samana Gotama is a destroyer of
beings.” “What is the reason for that? Because it is so, as
handed down in our scriptures.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
That nose, O Magandiya, which enjoys aromas, delights in aromas, rejoices in
aromas, has been tamed for the Tathagata, protected, guarded, restrained,
and he teaches the Dhamma for their restraint. For you, O māgandiya, was it
with reference to this that this was said: “The samana Gotama is a
destroyer of beings.” It was with reference to just this, master
Gotama, that this was said: “The samana Gotama is a destroyer of
beings.” “What is the reason for that? Because it is so, as
handed down in our scriptures.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
That tongue, O Magandiya, which enjoys flavors, delights in flavors,
rejoices in flavors, has been tamed for the Tathagata, protected, guarded,
restrained, and he teaches the Dhamma for their restraint. For you, O
māgandiya, was it with reference to this that this was said: “The samana
Gotama is a destroyer of beings.” It was with reference to just
this, master Gotama, that this was said: “The samana Gotama is a
destroyer of beings.” “What is the reason for that? Because it
is so, as handed down in our scriptures.”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
That body, O Magandiya, which enjoys tangibles, delights in tangibles,
rejoices in tangibles, has been tamed for the Tathagata, protected, guarded,
restrained, and he teaches the Dhamma for their restraint. For you, O
māgandiya, was it with reference to this that this was said: “The samana
Gotama is a destroyer of beings.” It was with reference to just
this, master Gotama, that this was said: “The samana Gotama is a
destroyer of beings.” “What is the reason for that? Because it
is so, as handed down in our scriptures.”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
That mind, O Magandiya, which enjoys dhammas, delights in dhammas, rejoices
in dhammas, has been tamed for the Tathagata, protected, guarded,
restrained, and he teaches the Dhamma for their restraint. For you, O
māgandiya, was it with reference to this that this was said: “The samana
Gotama is a destroyer of beings.” It was with reference to just
this, master Gotama, that this was said: “The samana Gotama is a
destroyer of beings.” “What is the reason for that? Because it
is so, as handed down in our scriptures.”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
So what do you think, O Magandiya? Here, a certain one might have previously
caused to amuse himself with forms cognizable by the eye that are agreeable,
lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of
lust. He, on another occasion, having known as it has come to be just the
arising, the disappearance, the gratification, the liability and the
stepping out of forms, having abandoned lust for forms, having dispelled
fever for forms, might abide rid of thirst, with a mind inwardly
calmed. Now, O Magandiya, what might you say to him? Nothing, O master
Gotama.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
So what do you think, O Magandiya? Here, a certain one might have previously
caused to amuse himself with sounds cognizable by the ear that are
agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected with sensual desires,
provocative of lust. He, on another occasion, having known as it has come to
be just the arising, the disappearance, the gratification, the liability and
the stepping out of sounds, having abandoned lust for sounds, having
dispelled fever for sounds, might abide rid of thirst, with a mind inwardly
calmed. Now, O Magandiya, what might you say to him? Nothing, O master
Gotama.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
So what do you think, O Magandiya? Here, a certain one might have previously
caused to amuse himself with aromas cognizable by the nose that are
agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected with sensual desires,
provocative of lust. He, on another occasion, having known as it has come to
be just the arising, the disappearance, the gratification, the liability and
the stepping out of aromas, having abandoned lust for aromas, having
dispelled fever for aromas, might abide rid of thirst, with a mind inwardly
calmed. Now, O Magandiya, what might you say to him? Nothing, O master
Gotama.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
So what do you think, O Magandiya? Here, a certain one might have previously
caused to amuse himself with flavors cognizable by the tongue that are
agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected with sensual desires,
provocative of lust. He, on another occasion, having known as it has come to
be just the arising, the disappearance, the gratification, the liability and
the stepping out of flavors, having abandoned lust for flavors, having
dispelled fever for flavors, might abide rid of thirst with a mind inwardly
calmed. Now, O Magandiya, what might you say to him? Nothing, O master
Gotama.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
So what do you think, O Magandiya? Here, a certain one might have previously
caused to amuse himself with tangibles cognizable by the body that are
agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected with sensual desires,
provocative of lust. He, on another occasion, having known as it has come to
be just the arising, the disappearance, the gratification, the liability and
the stepping out of tangibles, having abandoned lust for tangibles, having
dispelled fever for tangibles, might abide rid of thirst with a mind
inwardly calmed. Now, O Magandiya, what might you say to him? Nothing, O
master Gotama.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
Yet formerly, O Magandiya, indeed when I was a householder, being furnished
and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure, caused to amuse myself
with forms cognizable by the eye that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing,
endearing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust; with sounds
cognizable by the ear that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing,
connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust; with aromas cognizable
by the nose that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected with
sensual desires, provocative of lust; with flavors cognizable by the tongue
that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected with sensual
desires, provocative of lust; with tangibles cognizable by the body that are
agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected with sensual desires,
provocative of lust. In reference to that, O Magandiya, there were three
mansions for me: one for the rainy season, one for the cold season, one for
the hot season. I, O Magandiya, spent the four months of the rains in that
rainy season mansion, being served entirely by female musicians, and I did
not decend to the lower mansion. On another occasion, having known as it has
come to be, just the arising, the disappearance, the gratification, the
liability and the stepping out of sensual pleasures, I abandoned lust for
sensual pleasures, dispelled fever for sensual pleasures, I abide rid of
thirst, with a mind inwardly calmed. I see other beings not rid of lust in
sensual pleasures, being devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, burning
with fever for sensual pleasures, endulging in sensual pleasures, [but] I do
not envy them, nor do I find pleasure therein. What is the reason for that?
Because, O Magandiya, that which is this delight just apart from sensual
pleasures, apart from unwholesome dhammas which even surpasses the level of
divine pleasures, having liking for that, delighting in that, I do not envy
what is inferior, nor do I find pleasure therein.

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
“Just as, O Magandiya, a head of household or head of household's son,
wealthy, having great riches, one endowed with great wealth indeed, being
furnished and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure, might amuse
himself with forms cognizable by the eye that are agreeable, lovely,
pleasing, endearing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust;
with sounds cognizable by the ear that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing,
endearing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust; with aromas
cognizable by the nose that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing,
connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust; with flavors cognizable
by the tongue that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected
with sensual desires, provocative of lust; with tangibles cognizable by the
body that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected with sensual
desires, provocative of lust. Having conducted himself with good bodily
conduct, having conducted himself with good verbal conduct, having conducted
himself with good mental conduct, with the breakup of the body, after death,
he might reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world in companionship
with the devas of Tavatimsa. There in the Nandana grove surrounded by a
multitude of nymphs, indeed being furnished and endowed with the five cords
of divine sensual pleasure, might amuse himself. He might see a head of
household or head of household's son being furnished and endowed with the
five cords of sensual pleasure indeed amusing himself. So what do you think,
O Magandiya, would the son of devas surrounded by a multitude of nymphs in
the Nandana grove, amusing himself furnished and endowed with the five cords
of divine sensual pleasure, long for the head of household or head of
household's son amusing himself furnished and endowed with the five cords of
human sensual pleasure, or might he be enticed by human sensual
pleasures?” No master Gotama. What is the reason for that?
“Master Gotama, divine sensual pleasures are more brilliant and more
excellent than human sensual pleasures.”

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
In the same way, O Magandiya, formerly when I was a householder, being
furnished and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure, caused to
amuse myself with forms cognizable by the eye that are agreeable, lovely,
pleasing, endearing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust;
with sounds cognizable by the ear that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing,
endearing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust; with aromas
cognizable by the nose that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing,
connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust; with flavors cognizable
by the tongue that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected
with sensual desires, provocative of lust; with tangibles cognizable by the
body that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected with sensual
desires, provocative of lust. In reference to that, O Magandiya, there were
three mansions for me: one for the rainy season, one for the cold season,
one for the hot season. I, O Magandiya, spent the four months of the rains
in that rainy season mansion, being served entirely by female musicians, and
I did not decend to the lower mansion. On another occasion, having known as
it has come to be, just the arising, the disappearance, the gratification,
the liability and the stepping out of sensual pleasures, I abandoned lust
for sensual pleasures, dispelled fever for sensual pleasures, I abide rid of
thirst, with a mind inwardly calmed. I see other beings not rid of lust in
sensual pleasures, being devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, burning
with fever for sensual pleasures, endulging in sensual pleasures, [but] I do
not envy them, nor do I find pleasure therein. What is the reason for that?
Because, O Magandiya, that which is this delight just apart from sensual
pleasures, apart from unwholesome dhammas which even surpasses the level of
divine pleasures, having liking for that, delighting in that, I do not envy
what is inferior, nor do I find pleasure therein.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
“Just as, O Magandiya, a man who is a leper with sores on his body, his
decaying body being devoured by worms, scratching the surface of the wound
with his nails, roasting his body over a red hot charcoal pit. For him, his
friends and colleagues, blood relations, might hire a physician, a
surgeon. That physician or surgeon might make medicine so that owing to that
medicine he might be cured of his leprosy, become free from sickness, a
happy one, independent, being his own master, able to go wherever he
wishes. he might see another man who is a leper with sores on his body, his
decaying body being devoured by worms, scratching the surface of the wound
with his nails roasting his body over a red hot charcoal pit. So what do you
think, O Magandiya? Might that man envy that leper's use of charcoal pit and
medicine?” Indeed not, master Gotama. What is the reason for that?
“Because, master Gotama, medicine is to be applied when there is sickness
herein. Medicine is not to be applied when there is no sickness
herein.”

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
In the same way, O Magandiya, formerly when I was a householder, being
furnished and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure, caused to
amuse myself with forms cognizable by the eye that are agreeable, lovely,
pleasing, endearing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust;
with sounds cognizable by the ear that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing,
endearing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust; with aromas
cognizable by the nose that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing,
connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust; with flavors cognizable
by the tongue that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected
with sensual desires, provocative of lust; with tangibles cognizable by the
body that are agreeable, lovely, pleasing, endearing, connected with sensual

three mansions for me: one for the rainy season, one for the cold season,
one for the hot season. I, O Magandiya, spent the four months of the rains
in that rainy season mansion, being served entirely by female musicians, and
I did not decend to the lower mansion. On another occasion, having known as
it has come to be, just the arising, the disappearance, the gratification,

for sensual pleasures, dispelled fever for sensual pleasures, I abide rid of
thirst, with a mind inwardly calmed. I see other beings not rid of lust in
sensual pleasures, being devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, burning
with fever for sensual pleasures, endulging in sensual pleasures, [but] I do
not envy them, nor do I find pleasure therein. What is the reason for that?
Because, O Magandiya, that which is this delight just apart from sensual
pleasures, apart from unwholesome dhammas which even surpasses the level of
divine pleasures, having liking for that, delighting in that, I do not envy
what is inferior, nor do I find pleasure therein.

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
“Just as, O Magandiya, a man who is a leper with sores on his body, his
decaying body being devoured by worms, scratching the surface of the wound
with his nails, roasting his body over a red hot charcoal pit. For him, his
friends and colleagues, blood relations, might hire a physician, a
surgeon. That physician or surgeon might make medicine so that owing to that
medicine he might be cured of his leprosy, become free from sickness, a
happy one, independent, being his own master, able to go wherever he
wishes. To him two strong men having siezed him by different arms might drag
him near a red hot charcoal pit. So what do you think, O Magandiya? Might
that man only twist his body this way and that way?” Yes master
Gotama. What is the reason for that? “Because, O master Gotama, contact
with such fire is just painful, extremely hot and scorching.”
“So what do you think, O Magandiya? Is it only now that contact with such
fire is just painful, extremely hot and scorching or also formally, contact
with such fire was just painful, extremely hot and scorching?”
“Even now O master Gotama, contact with such fire is just painful, and
extremely hot and scorching. Also formally, contact with such fire was just
painful, extremely hot and scorching. But master Gotama, [when that man was]
a leper with sores on his body, his decaying body being devoured by worms,
scratching the surface of the wound with his nails, roasting his body over a
red hot charcoal pit, with impaired faculties, developed a distorted
perception of pleasure in the painful contact with fire.”

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
It is just so, O Magandiya, in the past too, sensual pleasures contact was
truly painful, extremely hot and scorching, in the future too, sensual
pleasures contact will be truly painful, extremely hot and scorching, at
present too, sensual pleasures contact are truly painful, extremely hot and
scorching, These beings, O Magandiya, not rid of lust in sensual pleasures,
being devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with fever for
sensual pleasures, endulging in sensual pleasures, with impaired faculties,
have developed a distorted perception of pleasure in the painful contact in
sensual pleasure.”

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
“Just as, O Magandiya, a man who is a leper with sores on his body, his
decaying body being devoured by worms, scratching the surface of the wound
with his nails, roasting his body over a red hot charcoal pit. In whichever
way a man who is a leper with sores on his body, his decaying body being
devoured by worms, scratches the surface of the wound with his nails and
roasts his body over a red hot charcoal pit, in consequence of that, the
surface of his wounds become even more repulsive, become even more
foul-smelling, become even more rotten. Yet there is just some measure of
pleasure, some measure of enjoyment, namely, with scratching the surface of
his wounds as cause.

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
It is just so, O Magandiya, [for] beings not rid of lust in sensual
pleasures, being devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with
fever for sensual pleasures, endulging in sensual pleasures. In whichever
way, O Magandiya, those beings not rid of lust in sensual pleasures, being
devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with fever for sensual
pleasures, endulge in sensual pleasures, as a consequence of that, those
beings craving for sensual pleasures only increase, their fever for sensual
pleasures only increase. Yet there is just some measure of pleasure, some
measure of enjoyment, namely, on account of the five cords of sensual
pleasure.

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
“So what do you think Magandiya? Perhaps you have seen or heard of a king
or royal minister who indeed causes to amuse himself furnished and endowed
with the five cords of sensual pleasure, without having abandoned craving
for sensual pleasure, without having dispelled fever for sensual pleasures,
who has abided, or abides, or will abide rid of thirst, with a mind inwardly
calmed.” Indeed not, master Gotama. Good māgandiya, I too, O
Magandiya, have also not seen or not heard of a king or royal minister who
indeed causes to amuse himself furnished and endowed with the five cords of
sensual pleasure, without having abandoned craving for sensual pleasure,
without having dispelled fever for sensual pleasures, who has abided, or
abides, or will abide rid of thirst, with a mind inwardly calmed.”
“Now, O Magandiya, indeed any samana or brahmana who abided rid of
thirst, with a mind inwardly calmed, or is abiding, or will abide, all those
having known as it has come to be just the arising, the disappearance, the
gratification, the liability and the stepping out of sensual pleasures,
abandoned lust for sensual pleasures, dispelled fever for sensual pleasures,
they abided rid of thirst, with a mind inwardly calmed, or are abiding, or
will abide.”

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
So then, the Auspicious One at that time uttered this inspired utterance:

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Freedom from [all] diseases is the highest gain,<br> nibbana, the highest
pleasure; and of paths, the eight-factored,<br> leads safely to the
deathless.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
When thus was said, Magandiya, the wanderer said this to the Auspicious One:
“Marvellous, master Gotama. Unprecedented master Gotama, the extent to
which this is well-stated by the venerable Gotama:

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Freedom from [all] diseases is the highest gain,<br> nibbana, the highest
pleasure.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">27</span>
We too have heard this said, O master Gotama, of former wanderers, teachers
of teachers:

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Freedom from [all] diseases is the highest gain,<br> nibbana, the highest
pleasure.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">28</span>
This agrees with that, O master Gotama.”

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
But for you, O Magandiya, of this saying which you heard of former
wanderers, teachers of teachers:

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Freedom from [all] diseases is the highest gain,<br> nibbana, the highest
pleasure.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">30</span>
“What is that freedom from [all] diseases, what is that
nibbana?” When thus was said, Māgandiya, the wanderer, just robbed
over his own body with his hands [saying:] “This is that freedom from
[all] diseases, O master Gotama, this is that nibbana. Indeed, O Master
Gotama, I at present, am free from sickness and happy, since nothing
afflicts me.”

<p><span class="parno">31</span>
Just as, O Māgandiya, a man blind from birth, who cannot see black or white
forms, cannot see blue forms, cannot see yellow forms, cannot see red forms,
cannot see crimson forms, cannot see the even and uneven, cannot see the
stars, cannot see the moon and sun, he might hear one possessed of eyes
saying: “Flawless indeed, sir, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless and
clean. He would walk in search of a white [cloth]. To him another man might
cheat with a coarse robe stained with oil [saying]: Here for you good man,
is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless and clean. He would accept it. Having
accepted it, he would wrap himself with it. Having wrapped himself with it,
contented, he would utter these words of contentment: “Flawless indeed,
sir, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless and clean.” So what do
you think, Magandiya? When that man blind from birth, accepted the coarse
robe stained with oil, [and] having accepted it, he would wrap himself with
it [and] having wrapped himself with it, contented, he would utter these
words of contentment: “Flawless indeed, sir, is a white cloth, beautiful,
spotless and clean,” would he have done so knowing and seeing, or
out of faith in the man who possessed eyes?” Indeed Master Gotama,
when that man blind from birth, accepted the coarse robe stained with oil,
[and] having accepted it he would wrap himself with it, [and] having wrapped
himself with it, contented, he would utter these words of contentment:
“Flawless indeed, sir, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless and
clean,” he would have done so not knowing and not seeing, but out
of faith in the man who possessed eyes.” It is just so, O
Magandiya, wanderers of other standpoints are blind, without eyes. They do
not know freedom from [all] diseases, they do not see nibbana. But yet, they
utter this stanza:

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Freedom from [all] diseases is the highest gain,<br> nibbana, the highest
pleasure.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">32</span>
These stanzas, O Magandiya, were uttered by past arahants, rightly
self-awakened Buddhas:

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Freedom from [all] diseases is the highest gain,<br> nibbana, the highest
pleasure; and of paths, the eight-factored,<br> leads safely to the
deathless.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">33</span>
At present, it has gradually gone to puthujjanas. “Although, O Magandiya,
this body is an enbodiment of disease, an enbodiment of tumor, an enbodiment
of a dart, an embodiment of a calamity, an embodiment of an affliction,
[yet] you say of this body which is an enbodiment of disease, an enbodiment
of tumor, an enbodiment of a dart, an embodiment of a calamity, an
embodiment of an affliction that: “This is that freedom from [all]
diseases, O master Gotama, this is that nibbana.” Indeed for you, O
Magandiya, that noble eye does not exist, the noble eye by which you can
know freedom from [all] diseases, see nibbana.”

<p><span class="parno">34</span>
“I have confidence for the master Gotama thus, the venerable Gotama is
able to teach me the dhamma in such a way that I might know freedom from
[all] diseases, that I might see nibbana.”

<p><span class="parno">35</span>
“Just as, O Māgandiya, a man blind from birth, who cannot see black or
white forms, cannot see blue forms, cannot see yellow forms, cannot see red
forms, cannot see crimson forms, cannot see the even and uneven, cannot see
the stars, cannot see the moon and sun. For him, his friends and colleagues,
blood relations, might hire a physician, a surgeon. That physician or
surgeon might make medicine [but] owing to that medicine, his eyes would not
arise, his eyes would not be purified. So what do you think, O Magandiya,
wouldn't that doctor only partake in weariness and frustration?”
Yes, master Gotama.

<p><span class="parno">36</span>
“It is just so, O Magandiya, even [if] I would to teach the Dhamma for
you [thus]: This is that freedom from [all] diseases, this is that
nibbana. That you may not know that freedom from [all] diseases, you may not
see that nibbana, that will be wearisome for me, that will be
troublesome.”

<p><span class="parno">37</span>
“I have confidence for the master Gotama thus, the venerable Gotama is
able to teach me the dhamma in such a way that I might know freedom from
[all] diseases, that I might see nibbana.”

<p><span class="parno">38</span>
Just as, O Māgandiya, a man blind from birth, who cannot see black or white
forms, cannot see blue forms, cannot see yellow forms, cannot see red forms,
cannot see crimson forms, cannot see the even and uneven, cannot see the
stars, cannot see the moon and sun, he might hear one possessed of eyes
saying: “Flawless indeed, sir, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless and
clean. He would walk in search of a white [cloth]. To him another man might
cheat with a coarse robe stained with oil [saying]: Here for you good man,
is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless and clean. He would accept it. Having
accepted it, he would wrap himself with it. Having wrapped himself with it,
contented, he would utter these words of contentment: “Flawless indeed,
sir, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless and clean.” For him, his
friends and colleagues, blood relations, might hire a physician, a
surgeon. That physician or surgeon might make medicine: up-going purgatives,
down-going purgatives, ointments, counter-ointments and nasal medicine. So
owing to that medicine, his eyes would arise, his eyes would be
purified. For him, along with the arising of his eyes, his desire and lust
in that coarse robe stained with oil gets abandoned, and he might also burn
with unfriendliness towards that man. Rather, he might even burn with
adversity thinking he should be deprived of life [thus:] Indeed for a long
time sir, I have been cheated, deceived, tricked in this way by that man
with a coarse robe stained with oil [saying:] Here for you good man, is a
white cloth, beautiful, spotless and clean.

<p><span class="parno">39</span>
“It is just so, O Magandiya, even [if] I would to teach the Dhamma for
you [thus]: This is that freedom from [all] diseases, this is that
nibbana. That you may know that freedom from [all] diseases, you may see
that nibbana. Along with the arising of the [noble] eye, your desire and
lust for the five khandhas of appropriation gets abandoned, and it will
occur to you thus: Indeed for a long time sir, I have been cheated,
deceived, tricked in this way by this mind. Indeed I only appropriated form
when holding, only appropriated feeling when holding, only appropriated
perception when holding, only appropriated sankharas when holding, only
appropriated consciousness when holding. For me in dependence on holding,
there is being; in dependence on being, there is birth; in dependence on
birth, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental
suffering and despair arise. Just so, is the arising of this entire
amassment of suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">40</span>
“I have confidence for the master Gotama thus, the venerable Gotama is
able to teach me the dhamma in such a way that I might rise from my seat
without blindness.”

<p><span class="parno">41</span>
Well then you, O Magandiya, should associate with true men. Since you, O
Magandiya will associate with true men, therefore you, O Magandiya, will
hear the true Dhamma. Since you, O Magandiya, will hear the true Dhamma,
therefore you, O Magandiya, will practice the Dhamma in accordance with the
Dhamma. Since you, O Magandiya, will practice the Dhamma in accordance with
the Dhamma, therefore you, O Magandiya, will come to know just by yourself,
come to see by yourself: These are diseases, tumors and darts. Here,
diseases, tumors and darts cease without remainder. For me from the
cessation of holding, there is the cessation of being; from the cessation of
being, there is the cessation of birth; from the cessation of birth, old age
and death, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental suffering and
despair cease. Just so, is the cessation of this entire stock of
suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">42</span>
When thus was said, Māgandiya, the wanderer, said this to the Auspicious
One: “Excellent, O master Gotama! Excellent, O master Gotama! Just as, O
master Gotama, one might set upright what has been overturned, or open up
what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost, or bear an oil lamp
in the darkness so that those with good eyesight can see forms, just so has
the Dhamma been explained by the venerable Gotama in countless ways. I go,
to the Auspicious Gotama, as refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Bhikkhu
Sangha. May I gain the going forth in master Gotama's presence, may I obtain
the higher ordination.”

<p><span class="parno">43</span>
“Whoever, O Magandiya, was formally of another standpoint, and wishes for
the going forth, wishes for the higher ordination in this Dhamma and
Discipline, lives under probation for four months. After the four months, if
the bhikkhus are convinced, they may give him the going-forth, they may give
him the higher ordination to the state of a bhikkhu. But differences are
known by me on individual case by case basis.”

<p><span class="parno">44</span>
“If, O Bhante, one who was formally of another standpoint, and wishes for
the going forth, wishes for the higher ordination in this Dhamma and
Discipline, lives under probation for four months, and after the four
months, if the bhikkhus are convinced, they may give him the going-forth,
they may give him the higher ordination to the state of a bhikkhu, then I
will live on probation for four years. After the four years, if the bhikkhus
are convinced, they may give me the going-forth, they may give me the higher
ordination to the state of a bhikkhu.”

<p><span class="parno">45</span>
Indeed Magandiya, the wanderer, gained the going-forth in the Auspicious
One's presence, gained the higher ordination. Not long after his higher
ordination, the venerable Magandiya, dwelling alone, withdrawn, vigilant,
ardent, resolute, not long entered upon and dwelled in that unsurpassed
consummation of the life of purity for the sake of which sons of clansmen
justly and rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness,
having realized it with his own higher knowledge in just this very life. He
understood: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity, done is
what had to be done, there is no other for thusness.” And the
venerable Magandiya became one of the arahants.
