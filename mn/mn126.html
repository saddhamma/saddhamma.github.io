Thus was heard by me. At one time, the Auspicious One was living at Rājagaha
at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel's Feeding Place. It so happened that in
the morning, the venerable Bhumija, having dressed, having taken bowl and
robe, stopped by Prince Jayasena's house. Upon arrival, he sat down on a
prepared seat.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Then, Prince Jayasena went to the venerable Bhumija. Upon arrival, he they
exchanged friendly greetings with the venerable Bhumija. Having exchanged
friendly greetings and amiable talk, he sat down to one side. Having sat to
one side, Prince Jayasena said this to the venerable Bhumija: “There are,
Master Bhumija, some samanas and brahmanas who hold such a doctrine, such a
view: “If, having made an aspiration, one leads the life of purity, one
is incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if, having made no aspiration, one
leads the life of purity, one is incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if,
having made both an aspiration and no aspiration, one leads the life of
purity, one is incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if, having made
neither an aspiration nor non aspiration, one leads the life of purity, one
is incapable of attaining any fruit.” Here, what is Master
Bhumija's Teacher's doctrine, what does he declare?”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“Prince, this has not been heard by me in the presence of the Auspicious
One, not received in his presence. But this possibility is to be found, in
that the Auspicious One might declare thus: “ If, having made an
aspiration, one leads the life of purity not [based on] the root cause [for
purity], one is incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if, having made no
aspiration, one leads the life of purity not [based on] the root cause [for
purity], one is incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if, having made both
an aspiration and no aspiration, one leads the life of purity not [based on]
the root cause [for purity], one is incapable of attaining any fruit. Also
if, having made neither an aspiration nor non aspiration, one leads the life
of purity not [based on] the root cause [for purity], one is incapable of
attaining any fruit. If, having made an aspiration, one leads the life of
purity [based on] the root cause [for purity], one is capable of attaining
fruit. Also if, having made no aspiration, one leads the life of purity
[based on] the root cause [for purity], one is capable of attaining
fruit. Also if, having made both an aspiration and no aspiration, one leads
the life of purity [based on] the root cause [for purity], one is capable of
attaining fruit. Also if, having made neither an aspiration nor non
aspiration, one leads the life of purity [based on] the root cause [for
purity], one is capable of attaining fruit.” Prince, this has not
been heard by me in the presence of the Auspicious One, not received in his
presence. But this possibility is to be found, in that the Auspicious One
might declare thus.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
“If thus is Master Bhumija's Teacher's doctrine, thus is what he
declares, then I think certainly Master Bhumija's Teacher simply stands
having defeated all the foolish ordinary samanas and brahmanas.”
Then Prince Jayasena served the venerable Bhumija with his very own dish of
boiled rice.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
So then, the venerable Bhumija, having taken almsfood at Prince Jayasena's
house, having risen from his seat, departed. Then after the meal, the
venerable Bhumija, having gone back after alms gathering, he visited with
the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, he bowed down to the Auspicious One and
sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the venerable Bhumija
said this to the Auspicious One: “Here Bhante, in the morning, having
dressed, having taken bowl and robe, I stopped by Prince Jayasena's
house. Upon arrival, I sat down on a prepared seat. Then, Prince Jayasena
came to me. Upon arrival, we exchanged friendly greetings with me. Having
exchanged friendly greetings and amiable talk, he sat down to one
side. Having sat to one side, Prince Jayasena said this to me: “There
are, Master Bhumija, some samanas and brahmanas who hold such a doctrine,
such a view: “If, having made an aspiration, one leads the life of
purity, one is incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if, having made no
aspiration, one leads the life of purity, one is incapable of attaining any
fruit. Also if, having made both an aspiration and no aspiration, one leads
the life of purity, one is incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if, having
made neither an aspiration nor non aspiration, one leads the life of purity,
one is incapable of attaining any fruit.” Here, what is Master
Bhumija's Teacher's doctrine, what does he declare?”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
When thus was said, Bhante, I said this to Prince Jayasena: “Prince, this
has not been heard by me in the presence of the Auspicious One, not received
in his presence. But this possibility is to be found, in that the Auspicious
One might declare thus: “If, having made an aspiration, one leads the
life of purity not [based on] the root cause [for purity], one is incapable
of attaining any fruit. Also if, having made no aspiration, one leads the
life of purity not [based on] the root cause [for purity], one is incapable
of attaining any fruit. Also if, having made both an aspiration and no
aspiration, one leads the life of purity not [based on] the root cause [for
purity], one is incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if, having made
neither an aspiration nor non aspiration, one leads the life of purity not
[based on] the root cause [for purity], one is incapable of attaining any
fruit. If, having made an aspiration, one leads the life of purity [based
on] the root cause [for purity], one is capable of attaining fruit. Also if,
having made no aspiration, one leads the life of purity [based on] the root
cause [for purity], one is capable of attaining fruit. Also if, having made
both an aspiration and no aspiration, one leads the life of purity [based
on] the root cause [for purity], one is capable of attaining fruit. Also if,
having made neither an aspiration nor non aspiration, one leads the life of

fruit.” Prince, this has not been heard by me in the presence of
the Auspicious One, not received in his presence. But this possibility is to
be found, in that the Auspicious One might declare thus.” [Then
Prince Jayasena said thus:] “If thus is Master Bhumija's Teacher's
doctrine, thus is what he declares, then I think certainly, Master Bhumija's
Teacher simply stands having defeated all the foolish ordinary samanas and
brahmanas.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
I hope, O Bhante, that by answering thus when such [a question] was brought
up, I speak just what is said by the Auspicious One, and not slander the
Auspicious One with what is contrary to the Dhamma, and that I answered in
accordance with the Dhamma so that whoever is a Dhamma companion, will not
arrive at a reason for my assertions to be blamed.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Certainly, O Bhumija, by answering thus when such [a question] was brought
up, you speak just what is said by me, and not slander me with what is
contrary to the Dhamma, and you answered in accordance with the Dhamma so
that whoever is a Dhamma companion, will not arrive at a reason for your
assertions to be blamed.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Indeed, O Bhumija, whichever samanas or brahmanas [possess] misguided view,
misguided thought, misguided speech, misguided action, misguided livelihood,
misguided effort, misguided mindfulness, misguided samadhi, for them, if
having made an aspiration, they lead the life of purity, they are incapable
of attaining any fruit. Also if, having made no aspiration, they lead the
life of purity, they are incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if, having
made both an aspiration and no aspiration, they lead the life of purity,
they are incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if, having made neither an
aspiration nor non aspiration, they lead the life of purity, they are
incapable of attaining any fruit. What is the reason for that? Because, O
Bhumija, this is not the root cause for the attainment of fruit.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Just as, O Bhumija, a man desirous of sesame oil, a seeker of sesame oil,
wandering in search of sesame oil, having heaped up sand in a tub, having
sprinkle it all over with water, would crush it. If, having made an
aspiration, having heaped up sand in a tub, having sprinkle it all over with
water, would crush it, he is incapable of attaining any sesame oil. Also if,
having made no aspiration, having heaped up sand in a tub, having sprinkle
it all over with water, would crush it, he is incapable of attaining sesame
oil. Also if, he both makes an aspiration and no aspiration, having heaped
up sand in a tub, having sprinkle it all over with water, would crush it, he
is incapable of attaining any sesame oil. Also if, having made neither an
aspiration nor non aspiration, having heaped up sand in a tub, having
sprinkle it all over with water, would crush it, he is incapable of
attaining any sesame oil. What is the reason for that? Because, O Bhumija,
this is not the root cause for the attainment of sesame oil. In just the
same way, O Bhumija, whichever samanas or brahmanas [possess] misguided
view, misguided thought, misguided speech, misguided action, misguided
livelihood, misguided effort, misguided mindfulness, misguided samadhi, for
them, if having made an aspiration, they lead the life of purity, they are
incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if, having made no aspiration, they
lead the life of purity, they are incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if,
having made both an aspiration and no aspiration, they lead the life of
purity, they are incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if, having made
neither an aspiration nor non aspiration, they lead the life of purity, they
are incapable of attaining any fruit. What is the reason for that? Because,
O Bhumija, this is not the root cause for the attainment of fruit.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
Just as, O Bhumija, a man desirous of milk, a seeker of milk, wandering in
search of milk, would pull the horn of a cow with a young calf. If, having
made an aspiration, would pull the horn of a cow with a young calf, he is
incapable of attaining any milk. Also if, having made no aspiration, would
pull the horn of a cow with a young calf, he is incapable of attaining any
milk. Also if, having made both an aspiration and no aspiration, would pull
the horn of a cow with a young calf, he is incapable of attaining any
milk. Also if, having made neither an aspiration nor non aspiration, would
pull the horn of a cow with a young calf, he is incapable of attaining any
milk. What is the reason for that? Because, O Bhumija, this is not the root
cause for the attainment of milk. In just the same way, O Bhumija, whichever
samanas or brahmanas [possess] misguided view, misguided thought, misguided
speech, misguided action, misguided livelihood, misguided effort, misguided

having made no aspiration, they lead the life of purity, they are incapable
of attaining any fruit. Also if, having made both an aspiration and no
aspiration, they lead the life of purity, they are incapable of attaining
any fruit. Also if, having made neither an aspiration nor non aspiration,
they lead the life of purity, they are incapable of attaining any
fruit. What is the reason for that? Because, O Bhumija, this is not the root
cause for the attainment of fruit.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
Just as, O Bhumija, a man desirous of butter, a seeker of butter, wandering
in search of butter, having poured water into a small water pot, would churn
it with a churning stick. If, having made an aspiration, having poured water
into a small water pot, would churn it with a churning stick, he is
incapable of attaining any butter. Also if, having made no aspiration,
having poured water into a small water pot, would churn it with a churning
stick, he is incapable of attaining any butter. Also if, having made both an
aspiration and no aspiration, having poured water into a small water pot,
would churn it with a churning stick, he is incapable of attaining any
butter. Also if, having made neither an aspiration nor non aspiration,
having poured water into a small water pot, would churn it with a churning
stick, he is incapable of attaining any butter. What is the reason for that?
Because, O Bhumija, this is not the root cause for the attainment of
butter. In just the same way, O Bhumija, whichever samanas or brahmanas
[possess] misguided view, misguided thought, misguided speech, misguided
action, misguided livelihood, misguided effort, misguided mindfulness,
misguided samadhi, for them, if having made an aspiration, they lead the
life of purity, they are incapable of attaining any fruit. Also if, having

aspiration, they lead the life of purity, they are incapable of attaining
any fruit. Also if, having made neither an aspiration nor non aspiration,
they lead the life of purity, they are incapable of attaining any
fruit. What is the reason for that? Because, O Bhumija, this is not the root
cause for the attainment of fruit.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
Just as, O Bhumija, a man desirous of fire, a seeker of fire, wandering in
search of fire, having taken an upper kindling stick might rub it against a
wet sappy piece of wood. If, having made an aspiration, having taken an
upper kindling stick might rub it against a wet sappy piece of wood, he is

they lead the life of purity, they are incapable of attaining any

cause for the attainment of fruit.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
Indeed, O Bhumija, whichever samanas or brahmanas [possess] right view,
right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,
right mindfulness, right samadhi, for them, if having made an aspiration,
they lead the life of purity, they are capable of attaining fruit. Also if,

Just as, O Bhumija, a man desirous of sesame oil, a seeker of sesame oil,
wandering in search of sesame oil, having heaped up grain of sesamum in a

“If, O Bhumija, you would have naturally replied to Prince Jayasena with
these four similes, Prince Jayasena would have gain devotion for you. And
being devoted, would have made [known] his state of devotion for
you.”

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
But from when, O Bhante, will reply to Prince Jayasena with these four
similes naturally [occur] to me, just as [they occur] to the Auspicious One?
They are formerly unheard before.

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
This is what the Auspicious One said. Delighted, a venerable Bhumija
rejoiced in the Auspicious One's words.
