<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling in
Sāvatthi at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.  There, the Auspicious One
did address the bhikkhus: O bhikkhus, I only ever eat a meal in
one-sitting. But I, O bhikkhus, eating a meal in one-sitting, do perceive
that little affliction and that little illness, a lightness and strength and
a comfortable abiding. “Come you, O bhikkhus, you too must eat a meal
only in one-sitting. You too, O bhikkhus, eating a meal in one-sitting, you
will nevertheless perceive that little affliction and that little illness, a
lightness and strength and a comfortable abiding.”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
When thus was said, the venerable Bhaddali said this to the Auspicious One:
“I, O Bhante, cannot endeavor to eat a meal in one-sitting. Indeed
Bhante, there might be worry in me from eating a meal in one-sitting, there
might be regret.” “Well now Bhaddali, the place at which you are
invited [for alms], in that place, having eaten one portion, having also
taken out one portion, [you] may eat. Thus eating too, you bhaddāli, do keep
[yourself] going.” “Even so too, I, O Bhante, cannot endeavor to
eat a meal in one-sitting. Indeed Bhante, there might be worry in me from
eating a meal in one-sitting, there might be regret. So when the training
rule was being made known by the Auspicious One, when the bhikkhu Sangha was
upholding the training, the venerable Bhaddali declared his lack of
endurance for undertaking the training. So then, the venerable Bhaddali, for
all that three months, did not present [himself] face to face to the
Auspicious One, as happens for one who does not fulfill the training in line
with the Teacher's instructions.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
At that time, many bhikkhus were engaged in robe making for the Auspicious
One, [with the expectation:] “With the passing away of three months, the
Auspicious One will set out wondering when the robe is finished.”
So then, the venerable Bhaddali visited with those bhikkhus. Upon arrival,
he exchanged friendly greetings with those bhikkhus. Having exchange
greetings of friendliness and courtesy, he sat down to one side. Having sat
down to one side, those bhikkhus said this to the venerable
Bhaddali. “This robe making [here] friend Bhaddali, is being done for the
Auspicious One [with the expectation:] “With the passing away of three
months, the Auspicious One will set out wondering when the robe is
finished.” “Come now friend Bhaddali, pay good attention to this
advice. Let it not come to be even more difficult for you
afterwards.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
“Yes friends.” The venerable Bhaddali having replied to those
bhikkhus, went to the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, he bowed down to the
Auspicious One and he sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the
venerable Bhaddali said this to the Auspicious One. A transgression overcame
me, O Bhante, in that being so foolish, so deluded, so unskillful, when the
training rule was being made known by the Auspicious One, when the bhikkhu
Sangha was upholding the training, I declared my lack of endurance for
undertaking the training. Bhante, may the Auspicious One forgive my
transgression seen as transgression for the sake of future restraint.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Certainly, a transgression overcame you Bhaddali, in that being so foolish,
so deluded, so unskillful, when the training rule was being made known by
me, when the bhikkhu Sangha was upholding the training, you declared your
lack of endurance for undertaking the training.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
On that occasion, O Bhaddali, this was not comprehended by you: “The
Auspicious One dwells in [this] very Sāvatthi. The Auspicious One will know
me [thus:] indeed the bhikkhu Bhaddali, is one who does not fulfill the
training in line with the Teacher's instructions.” On that
occasion, O Bhaddali, this was not comprehended by you.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
On that occasion, O Bhaddali, this too was not comprehended by you: “Many
bhikkhus have come to [this] very Sāvatthi for the rains. Those too will
know me [thus:] the bhikkhu named Bhaddali, is one who does not fulfill the
training in line with the Teacher's instructions.” On that
occasion, O Bhaddali, this too was not comprehended by you.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
On that occasion, O Bhaddali, this too was not comprehended by you: “Many
bhikkhunis have come to [this] very Sāvatthi for the rains. Those too will
know me [thus:] the bhikkhu named Bhaddali, is one who does not fulfill the
training in line with the Teacher's instructions.” On that
occasion, O Bhaddali, this too was not comprehended by you.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
On that occasion, O Bhaddali, this too was not comprehended by you: “Many
male lay disciples dwell in [this] very Sāvatthi. Those too will know me
[thus:] the bhikkhu named Bhaddali, is one who does not fulfill the training
in line with the Teacher's instructions.” On that occasion, O
Bhaddali, this too was not comprehended by you.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
On that occasion, O Bhaddali, this too was not comprehended by you: “Many
female lay disciples dwell in [this] very Sāvatthi. Those too will know me
[thus:] the bhikkhu named Bhaddali, is one who does not fulfill the training
in line with the Teacher's instructions.” On that occasion, O
Bhaddali, this too was not comprehended by you.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
On that occasion, O Bhaddali, this too was not comprehended by you: “Many
samanas and brahmanas of various sects have come to [this] very Sāvatthi for
the rains. Those too will know me [thus:] a certain elder bhikkhu named
Bhaddali, a disciple of the samana Gotama, is one who does not fulfill the
training.” On that occasion, O Bhaddali, this too was not
comprehended by you.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
A transgression overcame me, O Bhante, in that being so foolish, so deluded,
so unskillful, when the training rule was being made known by the Auspicious
One, when the bhikkhu Sangha was upholding the training, I declared my lack
of endurance for undertaking the training. Bhante, may the Auspicious One
forgive my transgression seen as transgression for the sake of future
restraint. Certainly, a transgression overcame you Bhaddali, in that being
so foolish, so deluded, so unskillful, when the training rule was being made
known by me, when the bhikkhu Sangha was upholding the training, you
declared your lack of endurance for undertaking the training.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
So what do you think Bhaddali? [Suppose] here that I might say of a both
ends liberated bhikkhu thus: “come you bhikkhu, be a bridge in the mud
for me.” Would he cross over [the mud himself] or would he turn his
body another way, or would he say “no.” Certainly not Bhante. So
what do you think Bhaddali? [Suppose] here that I might say of a wisdom
liberated bhikkhu thus: “come you bhikkhu, be a bridge in the mud for
me.” Would he cross over [the mud himself] or would he turn his
body another way, or would he say “no.” Certainly not Bhante. So
what do you think Bhaddali? [Suppose] here that I might say of a body
witness bhikkhu thus: “come you bhikkhu, be a bridge in the mud for
me.” Would he cross over [the mud himself] or would he turn his
body another way, or would he say “no.” Certainly not Bhante. So
what do you think Bhaddali? [Suppose] here that I might say of a view
attainer bhikkhu thus: “come you bhikkhu, be a bridge in the mud for
me.” Would he cross over [the mud himself] or would he turn his
body another way, or would he say “no.” Certainly not Bhante. So
what do you think Bhaddali? [Suppose] here that I might say of a faith
liberated bhikkhu thus: “come you bhikkhu, be a bridge in the mud for
me.” Would he cross over [the mud himself] or would he turn his
body another way, or would he say “no.” Certainly not Bhante. So
what do you think Bhaddali? [Suppose] here that I might say of a dhamma
follower bhikkhu thus: “come you bhikkhu, be a bridge in the mud for
me.” Would he cross over [the mud himself] or would he turn his
body another way, or would he say “no.” Certainly not Bhante. So
what do you think Bhaddali? [Suppose] here that I might say of a faith
follower bhikkhu thus: “come you bhikkhu, be a bridge in the mud for
me.” Would he cross over [the mud himself] or would he turn his
body another way, or would he say “no.” Certainly not Bhante. So
what do you think Bhaddali? “Were you then, O Bhaddali, on that occasion,
both ends liberated and wisdom liberated, or a body witness, or view
attainer, or faith liberated, or dhamma follower and faith
follower?”). Certainly not Bhante. “Were you not, O Bhaddali, on
that occasion empty, barren, and at fault?” Yes Bhante. A
transgression overcame me, O Bhante, in that being so foolish, so deluded,
so unskillful, when the training rule was being made known by the Auspicious
One, when the bhikkhu Sangha was upholding the training, I declared my lack
of endurance for undertaking the training. Bhante, may the Auspicious One
forgive my transgression seen as transgression for the sake of future
restraint.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
Certainly, a transgression overcame you Bhaddali, in that being so foolish,
so deluded, so unskillful, when the training rule was being made known by
me, when the bhikkhu Sangha was upholding the training, you declared your
lack of endurance for undertaking the training. But since you, O Bhaddali,
having seen your transgression as transgression, make amends in accordance
with the Dhamma for the sake of future restraint, we forgive you. For this
is growth indeed, O Bhaddali, in the Noble Ones' discipline when, having
seen one's transgression as transgression, one makes amends for the sake of
future restraint.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
Here, O Bhaddali, a certain bhikkhu is one who does not fulfill the training
in line with the Teacher's instructions. It occurs to him thus: What if I
were to resort to secluded lodging, a wilderness, a root of a tree, a
mountain glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a lonely spot in the
forest, the open air, a heap of straw. Perhaps I might realize a
beyond-human dhamma, a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the
Noble Ones. He resorts to a secluded lodging, a wilderness, a root of a
tree, a mountain glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a lonely spot in
the forest, the open air, a heap of straw. Of him dwelling thus withdrawn,
the Teacher censors [him]. Having found out, his wise companions in the life
of purity also censor [him]. The devas too censor [him]. He himself too
censors himself. He being censored by the Teacher, also censored by his wise
fellows in the life of purity having found out, also censored from the
devas, also self-censored by he himself, he does not realize a beyond-human
dhamma, a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the Noble Ones. What
is the reason for that? This is just so indeed, O Bhaddali, as happens for
one who does not fulfill the training in line with the Teacher's
instructions.

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
Here, O Bhaddali, a certain bhikkhu is one who fulfills the training in line
with the Teacher's instructions. It occurs to him thus: What if I were to

Noble Ones. What is the reason for that? This is just so indeed, O Bhaddali,
as happens for one who fulfills the training in line with the Teacher's
instructions.

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
“Quite secluded from sense-desires, secluded from unwholesome dhammas, he
enters upon and abides in the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
connected with thinking and pondering, the first jhana. What is the reason
for that? This is just so indeed, O Bhaddali, as happens for one who
fulfills the training in line with the Teacher's instructions.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
Furthermore, O Bhaddali, from the subsiding of thinking and pondering, with
the internal tranquilization and unification of mind [due to] the absense of
thinking and pondering, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the rapture and
pleasure born of samadhi, the second jhana. What is the reason for that?
This is just so indeed, O Bhaddali, as happens for one who fulfills the
training in line with the Teacher's instructions.

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
Furthermore, O Bhaddali, with detachment from rapture, a bhikkhu dwelling
mindful and clearly comprehending, looks on with equanimity as he
experiences pleasure in the body, of which the Noble Ones say: “He is a
mindful one who [looks on with] equanimity, one who dwells in
pleasure,” enters upon and abides in the third jhana. What is the
reason for that? This is just so indeed, O Bhaddali, as happens for one who
fulfills the training in line with the Teacher's instructions.

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
Furthermore, O Bhaddāli, from the abandoning of [physical] pleasure and
pain, from the extinction of former mental pleasure and mental pain, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the utter purity of mindfulness and
equanimity without pain and pleasure, the fourth jhana. What is the reason
for that? This is just so indeed, O Bhaddali, as happens for one who
fulfills the training in line with the Teacher's instructions.

When his samadhi is thus purified, cleansed, unblemished, devoid of
defilements, malleable, workable, steady, and attained to imperturbability,
he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of
beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he
sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, beautiful
and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate. He understands how beings pass on
according to their actions thus: “These worthy beings who were
ill-conducted in body, speech, and mind, revilers of Noble Ones, wrong in
their views, giving effect to wrong view in their actions, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a state of
deprivation, in a bad destination, in perdition, even in hell; but these
worthy beings who were well-conducted in body, speech, and mind, not
revilers of Noble Ones, right in their views, giving effect to right view in
their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared
in a good destination, even in the heavenly world.” Thus with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings
passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly,
fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on according
to their actions. What is the reason for that? This is just so indeed, O
Bhaddali, as happens for one who fulfills the training in line with the
Teacher's instructions.

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
When his samadhi is thus purified, cleansed, unblemished, devoid of
defilements, malleable, workable, steady, and attained to imperturbability,
he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the asavas. He understands
as it has come to be: “This is suffering”; he understands as it
has come to be: “This is the origin of suffering”; he
understands as it has come to be: “This is the cessation of
suffering”; he understands as it has come to be: “This is the
way leading to the cessation of suffering.” He understands as it
has come to be: “These are the asavas”; he understands as it has
come to be: “This is the origin of the asavas”; he understands
as it has come to be: “This is the cessation of the asavas”; he
understands as it has come to be: “This is the way leading to the
cessation of the asavas.” When he knows and sees thus, his mind is
liberated from the asava of sensual desire, from the asava of being, and
from the asava of ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge:
“It is liberated.” He understands: “Birth is destroyed, the
holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no
other for thusness.” What is the reason for that? This is just so
indeed, O Bhaddali, as happens for one who fulfills the training in line
with the Teacher's instructions.”
