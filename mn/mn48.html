not and pacification they (or causative: cause to) upati, not and one
another they (or causative: cause to) nijjhāpati, not and nijjhattiṃ they
(or causative: cause to) upati.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
it so happened that (or so then, later on or subsequently,
rather)<span class="note"> <span class="details"><span class="p">pts page 321 q 321</span></span></span> a certain o bhikkhu by which [way led
to] the Auspicious One , by that way (he or she or they) approached. having
approached the Auspicious One having bowed down sat down to one side. having
sat down to one side [infact or ever or very or do or really] so bhikkhu the
Auspicious One said this: here (this world)  Bhante kosambiyaṃ the bhikkhus

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
it so happened that (or so then, later on or subsequently, rather) the
Auspicious One addressed a certain aṃ bhikkhu: come you bhikkhu in my name
those (with/for you) the bhikkhus summon 'the Teacher venerable (s)

[way led to] those (with/for you) the bhikkhus , by that way (he or she or

this: the Teacher venerable summons (“|”). thus āvusoti [infact

by that way (he or she or they) approached. having approached the Auspicious
One having paid respects, they sat down to one side. having sat down to one
side, those (with/for you) the bhikkhus the Auspicious One  said this: is it
true as reported you (all) O bhikkhus quarrelsome disputatious contentious
