<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was living in Kosambi
at Ghosita's park. By then the bhikkhus at Kosambi were dwelling very
quarrelsome, disputatious, contentious, stabbing one another with the
daggers of the mouth. They just [could] not convince one another and [could]
not arrive at appeasement. And they [could] not win over one another and
[could] not arrive at understanding.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Then, by which [way led to] the Auspicious One, by that way a certain
bhikkhu approached. Having approached the Auspicious One, having bowed down,
he sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, that bhikkhu ever said
this to the Auspicious One: “Here, O Bhante, the bhikkhus at Kosambi are
dwelling quarrelsome, disputatious, contentious, stabbing one another with
the daggers of the mouth. They just [can] not convince one another and [can]
not arrive at appeasement. And they [can] not win over one another and [can]
not arrive at understanding.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
So then, the Auspicious One addressed a certain bhikkhu: Come you
bhikkhu. Tell those bhikkhus in my name: “the Teacher summons the
venerables.” “Yes, Bhante” that bhikkhu having replied
to the Auspicious One, by which [way led to] those bhikkhus, by that way he
approached. Having approached those bhikkhus, he said this: “The Teacher
summons the venerables.” Yes, friend. Those bhikkhus having replied
to that bhikkhu, by which [way led to] the Auspicious One, by that way they
approached. Having approached the Auspicious One, having paid respects, they
sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the Auspicious One  said
this to those bhikkhus: “Is it true as reported, that you, O bhikkhus,
are dwelling quarrelsome, disputatious, contentious, stabbing one another
with the daggers of the mouth. That you just [can] not convince one another
and [can] not arrive at appeasement. And that you [can] not win over one
another and [can] not arrive at understanding?” “Yes,
Bhante.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
“So what do you think, O bhikkhus. On the occasion when you abide
quarrelsome, disputatious, contentious, stabbing one another with the
daggers of the mouth, do you, on that occasion, extend bodily acts [of]
metta to your companions in the life of purity openly and also in secret;
and extend verbal acts [of] metta to your companions in the life of purity
openly and also in secret; and extend mental acts [of] metta to your
companions in the life of purity openly and also in secret?”
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“Thus really, O bhikkhus, on the occasion when you abide quarrelsome,
disputatious, contentious, stabbing one another with the daggers of the
mouth, on that occasion, you neither extend bodily acts [of] metta to your
companions in the life of purity openly and also in secret; nor extend
verbal acts [of] metta to your companions in the life of purity openly and
also in secret; nor extend mental acts [of] metta to your companions in the
life of purity openly and also in secret. Then what now, you worthless men,
knowing what, seeing what, do you dwell quarrelsome, disputatious,
contentious, stabbing one another with the daggers of the mouth. That you
just [can] not convince one another and [can] not arrive at appeasement. And
that you [can] not win over one another and [can] not arrive at
understanding? That indeed will be for you worthless men's harm and
suffering for a long time.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Then the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus: These six dhammas, O
bhikkhus, causing delight, making for affection, making for respect, lead to
friendliness, to non-contentiousness, to concord, to unity. Which six?

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu extends bodily acts of metta to his companions
in the life of purity openly and also in secret. This dhamma causing
delight, making for affection, making for respect, leads to friendliness, to
non-contentiousness, to concord, to unity.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu extends verbal acts of metta to his
companions in the life of purity openly and also in secret. This dhamma
causing delight, making for affection, making for respect, leads to
friendliness, to non-contentiousness, to concord, to unity.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu extends mental acts of metta to his
companions in the life of purity openly and also in secret. This dhamma
causing delight, making for affection, making for respect, leads to
friendliness, to non-contentiousness, to concord, to unity.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, that which is a righteous gain, righteously
acquired, including even so much as the mere contents of alms bowl, that
form of gain too, a bhikkhu enjoys it in common with his virtuous companions
in the life of purity, not making use of it without sharing with
others. This dhamma too causing delight, making for affection, making for
respect, leads to friendliness, to non-contentiousness, to concord, to
unity.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, that virtue which is unbroken, untorn, unmottled,
unspeckled, freeing, praised by the wise, untarnished, leading to samadhi,
having arrived at a virtue that is in conformity with such a form of virtue,
a bhikkhu dwells with his companions in the life of purity openly and also
in secret. This dhamma too causing delight, making for affection, making for
respect, leads to friendliness, to non-contentiousness, to concord, to
unity.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, this view which is noble, emancipating, delivering
the doer thereof to the thorough destruction of suffering, having arrived at
a view that is in conformity with such a form of view, a bhikkhu dwells with
his companions in the life of purity openly and also in secret. This dhamma
too causing delight, making for affection, making for respect, leads to
friendliness, to non-contentiousness, to concord, to unity.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
O bhikkhus, these six dhammas causing delight, making for affection, making
for respect, lead to friendliness, to non-contentiousness, to concord, to
unity.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
O bhikkhus, of these six dhammas ever causing delight, this is the foremost,
this holds it together, this binds it together, namely, the view which is
noble, emancipating, delivering the doer thereof to the thorough destruction
of suffering. Just as, O bhikkhus, for a building with a peaked roof this is
the foremost, this holds it together, this binds it together, namely, the
roofridge, just so, O bhikkhus, of these six dhammas ever causing delight,
this is the foremost, this holds it together, this binds it together,
namely, the view which is noble, emancipating, delivering the doer thereof
to the thorough destruction of suffering.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
And how, O bhikkhus, does this view which is noble, emancipating, deliver
the doer thereof to the thorough destruction of suffering?

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or gone to the root of the
tree or gone to an empty hut considers thus: is there really that internal
preoccupation unabandoned by me by which [being] so preoccupied may obsess
my mind that I may neither know nor see things as they have come to be?

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
If, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is overcome by sensual desire, then certainly, his
mind is obsessed. If, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is overcome by ill-will, then
certainly, his mind is obsessed. If, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is overcome by
sluggishness and lack of mental agility, then certainly, his mind is
obsessed. If, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is overcome by restlessness and remorse,
then certainly, his mind is obsessed. If, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is overcome
by doubt, then certainly, his mind is obsessed. If, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is
overcome by mentation about this world, then certainly, his mind is
obsessed. If, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is overcome by mentation about the other
world, then certainly, his mind is obsessed. If, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is
quarrelsome, disputatious, contentious, abides stabbing others mutually with
the daggers of the mouth, then certainly, his mind is obsessed.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
He understands thus: “There is in fact not that internal preoccupation
unabandoned by me by which [being] so preoccupied may obsess my mind that I
may neither know nor see things as they have come to be. My mind is well
inclined for the truths, for awakening”). This is the first
knowledge attained by him that is noble, supramundane, not in common with
puthujjanas.

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, a noble disciple considers thus: “While
pursuing, maturing, making abundant this view, do I really gain internal
tranquility, do I gain internal extinguishing?” He understands
thus: “In fact, while pursuing, maturing, making abundant this view, I do
gain internal tranquility, I do gain internal extinguishing.”This
is the second knowledge attained by him that is noble, supramundane, not in
common with puthujjanas.

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, a noble disciple considers thus: “Given such a
form of view that I am endowed with, is there really other ascetics or
brahmins from outside this [Buddha's dispensation] that are endowed with
such a form of view?” He understands thus: “Given such a form of
view that I am endowed with, there is no other ascetics or brahmins from
outside this [Buddha's dispensation] that are endowed with such a form of
view?” This is the third knowledge attained by him that is noble,
supramundane, not in common with puthujjanas.

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, a noble disciple considers thus: “That form of
character which an individual excelling in view is endowed with, am I too
endowed with such a form of character?”

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
And what form of character, O bhikkhus, is an individual excelling in view
endowed with? This, O bhikkhus, is the character of an individual
accomplished in view. By which form of offense there is a rehabilitation,
however much that form of offense he gets into, he just quickly makes it
evident to the Teacher or wise man or companions in the life of purity,
makes it known, makes it clear, makes a confession. Having made it known,
having made it clear, having made a confession, he undertakes future
restraint. Just as, O bhikkhus, a little young boy, an infant, having
treaded on a charcoal, just quickly withdraws his hand or foot, similarly, O
bhikkhus, this is the character of an individual accomplished in view: By
which form of offense there is a rehabilitation, however much that form of
offense he gets into, he just quickly makes it evident to the Teacher or
wise man or companions in the life of purity, makes it known, makes it
clear, makes a confession. Having made it known, having made it clear,
having made a confession, he undertakes future restraint.

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
He understands thus: “That form of character which an individual
excelling in view is endowed with, I too am endowed with such a form of
character?” This is the fourth knowledge attained by him that is
noble, supramundane, not in common with puthujjanas.

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, a noble disciple considers thus: “That form of
character which an individual excelling in view is endowed with, am I too
endowed with such a form of character?”

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
And what form of character, O bhikkhus, is an individual excelling in view
endowed with? This, O bhikkhus, is the character of an individual
accomplished in view: however much various obligations he has entered upon
with zeal for his companions in the life of purity there, he still has keen
desire for training in the higher virtue, for training in the higher states
of mind, for training in the higher wisdom. Just as, O bhikkhus, a cow with
a young calf grazes while watching over her small calf, just so, O bhikkhus,
is the character of an individual accomplished in view: however much various
obligations he has entered upon with zeal for his companions in the life of
purity there, he still has keen desire for training in the higher virtue,
for training in the higher states of mind, for training in the higher
wisdom.

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
He understands thus: “That form of character which an individual
excelling in view is endowed with, I too am endowed with such a form of
character?” This is the fifth knowledge attained by him that is
noble, supramundane, not in common with puthujjanas.

<p><span class="parno">27</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, a noble disciple considers thus: “That form of
strength which an individual excelling in view is endowed with, am I too
endowed with such a form of strength?”

<p><span class="parno">28</span>
And what form of strength, O bhikkhus, is an individual excelling in view
endowed with? This, O bhikkhus, is the strength of an individual
accomplished in view: When the Dhamma and Vinaya declared by the Tathāgata
is being taught, he listens to the dhamma, having made it his aim, having
attended to it with all his mind, having collected it together with eager
ears.

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
He understands thus: “That form of strength which an individual excelling
in view is endowed with, I too am endowed with such a form of
strength?” This is the sixth knowledge attained by him that is
noble, supramundane, not in common with puthujjanas.

<p><span class="parno">30</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, a noble disciple considers thus: “That form of
strength which an individual excelling in view is endowed with, am I too
endowed with such a form of strength?”

<p><span class="parno">31</span>
And what form of strength, O bhikkhus, is an individual excelling in view
endowed with? This, O bhikkhus, is the strength of an individual
accomplished in view: When the Dhamma and Vinaya declared by the Tathāgata
is being taught, he gains intuitive feeling of the meaning, gains intuitive
feeling of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma.

<p><span class="parno">32</span>
He understands thus: “That form of strength which an individual excelling
in view is endowed with, I too am endowed with such a form of
strength?” This is the seventh knowledge attained by him that is
noble, supramundane, not in common with puthujjanas.

<p><span class="parno">33</span>
“A noble disciple, O bhikkhus, thus endowed with seven factors, has
really well matched to perfection the character for realization of the fruit
of sotapanna. In fact a noble disciple, O bhikkhus, thus endowed with seven
factors, possesses the fruit of sotapanna.”

<p><span class="parno">34</span>
This is what the Auspicious One said. Delighted, those bhikkhus rejoiced in
the Auspicious One's words.
