<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling among the
Sakyans, at a Sakyan market town called Devadaha. At that place the
Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.”
“Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied to the Auspicious One. the
Auspicious One said this:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas who hold such doctrine,
such view: “Whatever this individual person experiences, whether
pleasure, pain or neither pain nor pleasure, all that is caused by what was
done in the past. So by the termination of past kamma with exertion, and the
non-doing of new kamma, [there is] no oozings in the future. From no oozings
in the future comes the destruction of kamma. From the destruction of kamma
comes the destruction of suffering. From the destruction of suffering comes
the destruction of feeling. From the destruction of feeling, all suffering
will be worn away.” Thus, O bhikkhus, is the doctrine of the
Niganthas.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Thus [being their] doctrine, O bhikkhus, having approached the Niganthas, I
say thus: “Is it true as reported, O friend Niganthas, that you hold such
doctrine, such view: “Whatever this individual person experiences,
whether pleasure, pain or neither pain nor pleasure, all that is caused by
what was done in the past. So by the termination of past kamma with
exertion, and the non-doing of new kamma, [there is] no oozings in the
future. From no oozings in the future comes the destruction of kamma. From
the destruction of kamma comes the destruction of suffering. From the
destruction of suffering comes the destruction of feeling. From the
destruction of feeling, all suffering will be worn away?”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Being asked by me thus, O bhikkhus, if the Niganthas acknowledge
“yes”, I say to them thus: But, O friend Niganthas, how do you
know? “Indeed, we were in the past. It is not the case that we were
not.”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Indeed, we don't know this, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
But O friend Niganthas, how do you know? “Indeed we did evil kamma in the
past. It is not the case that we did not.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Indeed, we don't know this, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
But O friend Niganthas, how do you know? “We did such or such evil kamma
in the past.”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Indeed, we don't know this, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
But O friend Niganthas, how do you know? “So much suffering has been worn
away or so much suffering remains to be worn away, or certainly by the
wearing away of so much suffering, all suffering will be worn
away.”

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
Indeed, we don't know this, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
But O friend Niganthas, how do you know the abandoning of unwholesome
dhammas and the taking up of wholesome dhammas in this very life?

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
Indeed, we don't know this, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
Thus apparently, O friend Niganthas, you do not know: “Indeed, we were in
the past. It is not the case that we were not.” You do not know:
“Indeed we did evil kamma in the past. It is not the case that we did
not.” You do not know: “We did such or such evil kamma in the
past.” You do not know: “So much suffering has been worn away or
so much suffering remains to be worn away, or certainly by the wearing away
of so much suffering, all suffering will be worn away.” You do not
know the abandoning of unwholesome dhammas and the taking up of wholesome
dhammas in this very life. That being so, it would not be proper for the
venerable Niganthas to declare: “Whatever this individual person
experiences, whether pleasure, pain or neither pain nor pleasure, all that
is caused by what was done in the past. So by the termination of past kamma
with exertion, and the non-doing of new kamma, [there is] no oozings in the
future. From no oozings in the future comes the destruction of kamma. From
the destruction of kamma comes the destruction of suffering. From the
destruction of suffering comes the destruction of feeling. From the
destruction of feeling, all suffering will be worn away?”

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
If, O friend Niganthas, you could know: “Indeed, we were in the past. It
is not the case that we were not.” If you could know: “Indeed we
did evil kamma in the past. It is not the case that we did not.” If
you could know: “We did such or such evil kamma in the past.” If
you could know: “So much suffering has been worn away or so much
suffering remains to be worn away, or certainly by the wearing away of so
much suffering, all suffering will be worn away.” If you could know
the abandoning of unwholesome dhammas and the taking up of wholesome dhammas
in this very life, then it would be proper for the venerable Niganthas to
declare: “Whatever this individual person experiences, whether pleasure,
pain or neither pain nor pleasure, all that is caused by what was done in
the past. So by the termination of past kamma with exertion, and the
non-doing of new kamma, [there is] no oozings in the future. From no oozings
in the future comes the destruction of kamma. From the destruction of kamma
comes the destruction of suffering. From the destruction of suffering comes
the destruction of feeling. From the destruction of feeling, all suffering
will be worn away?”

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
Suppose, O friend Niganthas, a man were to be shot by an arrow thickly
smeared with poison. With the arrow as cause, he would feel a sharp, severe
painful feeling. For him, his friends, colleagues and blood relations, would
hire a physician, a surgeon. The physician or surgeon would cut open the
surface of the wound with a knife. With the cutting of the surface of the
wound too as cause, he would feel a sharp, severe painful feeling. The
physician or surgeon would probe for the arrow with a surgeon's probe. With
the probing for the arrow with a surgeon's probe too as cause, he would feel
a sharp, severe painful feeling. The physician or surgeon would pull out the
arrow. With the pulling out of the arrow too as cause, he would feel a
sharp, severe painful feeling. The physician or surgeon would apply some
medicinal powder on the surface of the wound. With the application of the
medicinal powder on the surface of the wound too as cause, he would feel a
sharp, severe painful feeling. On a later occasion, his wound would heal and
be covered with skin. Being free from illness, he would feel happy,
independent, being his own master, able to go wherever he wishes. It would
occur to him thus: “Formerly I was shot by an arrow thickly smeared with
poison. With the arrow as cause, I felt a sharp, severe painful feeling. My
friends, colleagues and blood relations, hired a physician, a surgeon. The
physician or surgeon cut open the surface of the wound with a knife. With
the cutting of the surface of the wound too as cause, I felt a sharp, severe
painful feeling. The physician or surgeon probed for the arrow with a
surgeon's probe. With the probing for the arrow with a surgeon's probe too
as cause, I felt a sharp, severe painful feeling. The physician or surgeon
pulled out the arrow. With the pulling out of the arrow too as cause, I felt
a sharp, severe painful feeling. The physician or surgeon applied some
medicinal powder on the surface of the wound. With the application of the
medicinal powder on the surface of the wound too as cause, I felt a sharp,
severe painful feeling. Indeed now my wound has healed and is covered with
skin. Being free from illness, I am happy, independent, being my own master,
able to go wherever I wish.”

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
So too, friend Niganthas, if you could know: “Indeed, we were in the
past. It is not the case that we were not.” If you could know:
“Indeed we did evil kamma in the past. It is not the case that we did
not.” If you could know: “We did such or such evil kamma in the
past.” If you could know: “So much suffering has been worn away
or so much suffering remains to be worn away, or certainly by the wearing
away of so much suffering, all suffering will be worn away.” If you
could know the abandoning of unwholesome dhammas and the taking up of
wholesome dhammas in this very life, then it would be proper for the
venerable Niganthas to declare: “Whatever this individual person
experiences, whether pleasure, pain or neither pain nor pleasure, all that
is caused by what was done in the past. So by the termination of past kamma
with exertion, and the non-doing of new kamma, [there is] no oozings in the
future. From no oozings in the future comes the destruction of kamma. From
the destruction of kamma comes the destruction of suffering. From the
destruction of suffering comes the destruction of feeling. From the
destruction of feeling, all suffering will be worn away?”

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
But because, O friend Niganthas, you do not know: “Indeed, we were in the
past. It is not the case that we were not.” You do not know:
“Indeed we did evil kamma in the past. It is not the case that we did
not.” You do not know: “We did such or such evil kamma in the
past.” You do not know: “So much suffering has been worn away or
so much suffering remains to be worn away, or certainly by the wearing away
of so much suffering, all suffering will be worn away.” You do not
know the abandoning of unwholesome dhammas and the taking up of wholesome
dhammas in this very life. That being so, it would not be proper for the
venerable Niganthas to declare: “Whatever this individual person
experiences, whether pleasure, pain or neither pain nor pleasure, all that
is caused by what was done in the past. So by the termination of past kamma
with exertion, and the non-doing of new kamma, [there is] no oozings in the
future. From no oozings in the future comes the destruction of kamma. From
the destruction of kamma comes the destruction of suffering. From the
destruction of suffering comes the destruction of feeling. From the
destruction of feeling, all suffering will be worn away?”

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
When thus was said, O bhikkhus, those Nigaṇṭhas said this to me: Nigantha
Nataputta, O friend, is all knowing and all seeing and acknowledges complete
knowledge and vision thus: “Whether I am walking or standing or sleeping
or awake, knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present
to me.” He says thus: “There is for you, O friend Niganthas,
evil kamma done in the past. Wear them away by this sharp and gruelling
austerities. When you are now restrained by body, restrained by speech and
restrained by mind here, that is the non-doing of evil kamma for the
future. Thus, by the elimination of past kamma with exertion, and the
non-doing of new kamma, [there is] no oozings in the future. From no oozings
in the future comes the destruction of kamma. From the destruction of kamma
comes the destruction of suffering. From the destruction of suffering comes
the destruction of feeling. From the destruction of feeling, all suffering
will be worn away?” Now we are very pleased and approve of that,
and so we are satisfied.”

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
When thus was said, O bhikkhus, I said this to those Niganthas: “These
five dhammas, O friend Niganthas, has twofold results in this very
life. Which five? Faith, preference, tradition, mode of reasoning and
submission to view after reflection. These five dhammas, O friend Niganthas,
has twofold results in this very life. Therein, for the venerable Niganthas,
what faith is there in a Teacher [who speaks] about the past? What
preference, what tradition, what mode of reasoning, what submission to view
after reflection?” When I said thus, O bhikkhus, I did not see
among the Niganthas any defence that accords with the Dhamma.

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, I said thus to those Niganthas: “So what do you
think, O friend Niganthas, indeed, on the occasion when for you there is
intense exertion, intense striving, on that occasion, do you feel
afflictive, painful, piercing, sharp feelings of the piercing [austerities]?
But on the occasion when for you there is no intense exertion, no intense
striving, on that occasion, do you not feel afflictive, painful, piercing,
sharp feelings of the piercing [austerities]?”

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
On the occasion, O friend Gotama, when for us there is intense exertion,
intense striving, on that occasion, we feel afflictive, painful, piercing,
sharp feelings of the piercing [austerities]? But on the occasion when for
us there is no intense exertion, no intense striving, on that occasion, we
do not feel afflictive, painful, piercing, sharp feelings of the piercing
[austerities]?”

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
Thus apparently, O friend Niganthas, on the occasion, when for you there is
intense exertion, intense striving, on that occasion, you feel afflictive,
painful, piercing, sharp feelings of the piercing [austerities]. But on the
occasion when for you there is no intense exertion, no intense striving, on
that occasion, you do not feel afflictive, painful, piercing, sharp feelings
of the piercing [austerities]. That being so, it would not be proper for the
venerable Niganthas to declare: “Whatever this individual person
experiences, whether pleasure, pain or neither pain nor pleasure, all that
is caused by what was done in the past. So by the termination of past kamma
with exertion, and the non-doing of new kamma, [there is] no oozings in the
future. From no oozings in the future comes the destruction of kamma. From
the destruction of kamma comes the destruction of suffering. from the
destruction of suffering comes the destruction of feeling. From the
destruction of feeling, all suffering will be worn away?”

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
If, O friend Niganthas, on the occasion, when for you there is intense
exertion, intense striving, on that occasion, you do not feel afflictive,
painful, piercing, sharp feelings of the piercing [austerities], but on the
occasion when for you there is no intense exertion, no intense striving, on
that occasion, you feel afflictive, painful, piercing, sharp feelings from
the piercing [austerities], then it would be proper for the venerable
Niganthas to declare: “Whatever this individual person experiences,
whether pleasure, pain or neither pain nor pleasure, all that is caused by
what was done in the past. So by the termination of past kamma with
exertion, and the non-doing of new kamma, [there is] no oozings in the
future. From no oozings in the future comes the destruction of kamma. From
the destruction of kamma comes the destruction of suffering. From the
destruction of suffering comes the destruction of feeling. From the
destruction of feeling, all suffering will be worn away?”

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
But because, O friend Niganthas, on the occasion, when for you there is
intense exertion, intense striving, on that occasion, you feel afflictive,
painful, piercing, sharp feelings of the piercing [austerities], yet on the
occasion when for you there is no intense exertion, no intense striving, on
that occasion, you do not feel afflictive, painful, piercing, sharp feelings
of the piercing [austerities], you are feeling just your own
self-afflictions that are afflictive, painful, piercing, sharp feelings of
the piercing [austerities]. Out of ignorance, lack of knowledge and
delusion, you declare: “Whatever this individual person experiences,
whether pleasure, pain or neither pain nor pleasure, all that is caused by
what was done in the past. So by the termination of past kamma with
exertion, and the non-doing of new kamma, [there is] no oozings in the
future. From no oozings in the future comes the destruction of kamma. From
the destruction of kamma comes the destruction of suffering. From the
destruction of suffering comes the destruction of feeling. From the
destruction of feeling, all suffering will be worn away?” When I
said thus too, O bhikkhus, I did not see among the Niganthas any defence
that accords with the Dhamma.

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, I said thus to those Niganthas: “So what do you
think, O friend Niganthas? Can it be gained thus: “By this exertion and
striving, let whichever kamma is to be experienced in this life be
experienced in the after-life?”

<p><span class="parno">27</span>
Indeed not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">28</span>
Then can it be gained thus: “By this exertion and striving, let whichever
kamma is to be experienced in the after-life be experienced in this
life?”

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
Indeed not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">30</span>
What do you think, O friend Niganthas? Can it be gained thus: “By this
exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is to be experienced as pleasant
be experienced as painful?”

<p><span class="parno">31</span>
Indeed not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">32</span>
Then can it be gained thus: “By this exertion and striving, let whichever
kamma is to be experienced as painful be experienced as pleasant?”

<p><span class="parno">33</span>
Indeed not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">34</span>
What do you think, O friend Niganthas? Can it be gained thus: “By this
exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is to be experienced when ripened
be experienced when unripened?”

<p><span class="parno">35</span>
Indeed not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">36</span>
Then can it be gained thus: “By this exertion and striving, let whichever
kamma is to be experienced when unripened be experienced when
ripened?”

<p><span class="parno">37</span>
Indeed not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">38</span>
What do you think, O friend Niganthas? Can it be gained thus: “By this
exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is to be experienced
substantially be experienced slightly?”

<p><span class="parno">39</span>
Indeed not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">40</span>
Then can it be gained thus: “By this exertion and striving, let whichever
kamma is to be experienced slightly be experienced substantially?”

<p><span class="parno">41</span>
Indeed not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">42</span>
What do you think, O friend Niganthas? Can it be gained thus: “By this
exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is to be experienced not be
experienced?”

<p><span class="parno">43</span>
Indeed not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">44</span>
Then can it be gained thus: “By this exertion and striving, let whichever
kamma is not to be experienced be experienced?”

<p><span class="parno">45</span>
Indeed not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">46</span>
Thus apparently, O friend Niganthas, it cannot be gained thus: “By this
exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is to be experienced in this life
be experienced in the after-life.” It cannot be gained thus: “By
this exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is to be experienced in the
after-life be experienced in this life.” It cannot be gained thus:
“By this exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is to be experienced
as pleasant be experienced as painful.” It cannot be gained thus:
“By this exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is to be experienced
as painful be experienced as pleasant.” It cannot be gained thus:
“By this exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is to be experienced
when ripened be experienced when unripened.” It cannot be gained
thus: “By this exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is to be
experienced when unripened be experienced when ripened.” It cannot
be gained thus: “By this exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is to
be experienced substantially be experienced slightly.” It cannot be
gained thus: “By this exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is to be
experienced slightly be experienced substantially.” It cannot be
gained thus: “By this exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is to be
experienced not be experienced.” It cannot be gained thus: “By
this exertion and striving, let whichever kamma is not to be experienced be
experienced.” That being so, the venerable Niganthas exertion is
fruitless, their striving is fruitless. Thus is the doctrine of the
Niganthas, O bhikkhus. Thus being the doctrine of the Niganthas, O bhikkhus,
there are ten grounds for criticism in accordance with the Dhamma.

<p><span class="parno">47</span>
If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and pain that beings experience are caused by
what was done in the past, then certainly, O bhikkhus, the Niganthas have
done bad kamma in the past, in that at present, they feel such painful,
piercing, sharp feelings. If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and pain that beings
experience are caused by a god's creation, then certainly, O bhikkhus, the
Niganthas have been created by an evil god, in that at present, they feel
such painful, piercing, sharp feelings. If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and
pain that beings experience are caused by a chance encounter, then
certainly, O bhikkhus, the Niganthas have evil luck, in that at present,
they feel such painful, piercing, sharp feelings. If, O bhikkhus, the
pleasure and pain that beings experience are caused by social class, then
certainly, O bhikkhus, the Niganthas belong to a bad social class, in that
at present, they feel such painful, piercing, sharp feelings. If, O
bhikkhus, the pleasure and pain that beings experience are caused by
striving in this life, then certainly, O bhikkhus, the Niganthas strive
badly in this life, in that at present, they feel such painful, piercing,
sharp feelings.

<p><span class="parno">48</span>
If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and pain that beings experience are caused by
what was done in the past, the Niganthas are to be censured. If the pleasure
and pain that beings experience are not caused by what was done in the past,
the Niganthas are to be censured. If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and pain that
beings experience are caused by a god's creation, the Niganthas are to be
censured. If the pleasure and pain that beings experience are not caused by
a god's creation, the Niganthas are to be censured. If, O bhikkhus, the
pleasure and pain that beings experience are caused by a chance encounter,
the Niganthas are to be censured. If the pleasure and pain that beings
experience are not caused by a chance encounter, the Niganthas are to be
censured. If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and pain that beings experience are
caused by social class, the Niganthas are to be censured. If the pleasure
and pain that beings experience are not caused by social class, the
Niganthas are to be censured. If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and pain that
beings experience are caused by striving in this life, the Niganthas are to
be censured. If the pleasure and pain that beings experience are not caused
by striving in this life, the Niganthas are to be censured. Thus being the
doctrine of the Niganthas, O bhikkhus, these are the ten grounds for
criticism in accordance with the Dhamma. Thus, O bhikkhus, their exertion is
fruitless, their striving is fruitless.

<p><span class="parno">49</span>
But how, O bhikkhus, is exertion fruitful, how is striving fruitful? Here O
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu most certainly does not cause to be an occasion of pain
for himself when the occasion has not come to be, yet he does not forsake
the pleasure that accords with the Dhamma, but he is not infatuated with
that pleasure therein. He wisely understands thus: “[When] willfully
striving, this source of suffering for me fades away due to the willful
striving. But [when] looking on with equanimity, this source of suffering
for me fades away due to the looking on with equanimity. So indeed for him
[wherein] a source of suffering fades away due to willful striving, therein
he willfully strives. [Wherein] a source of suffering fades away due to the
looking on with equanimity, therein he develops equanimity.”
Willfully striving, whichever source of suffering fades away due to the
willful striving, that fades away. Thus, that suffering is worn
away. Looking on with equanimity, whichever source of suffering fades away
due to looking on with equanimity, that fades away. Thus, that suffering is
worn away.

<p><span class="parno">50</span>
Suppose, O bhikkhus, a man was in love with a woman with his mind bound to
her, infatuated, with intense desire, with intense want. He might see that
woman with another man, standing together, chatting, joking and laughing. So
what do you think, O bhikkhus? “Would there arise sorrow, lamentation,
physical suffering, mental suffering and despair in such a man having seen
that woman with another man, standing together, chatting, joking and
laughing?”

<p><span class="parno">51</span>
Yes Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">52</span>
What is the reason for that?

<p><span class="parno">53</span>
“Because, O Bhante, such a man is in love with that woman with his mind
bound to her, infatuated, with intense desire, with intense want. Therefore
having seen that woman with another man, standing together, chatting, joking
and laughing, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental suffering and
despair would arise in him.”

<p><span class="parno">54</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it would occur to that man thus: “I am in love with
such a woman with my mind bound to her, infatuated, with intense desire,
with intense want. For me having seen that woman with another man, standing
together, chatting, joking and laughing, sorrow, lamentation, physical
suffering, mental suffering and despair arise in me. What if I were to
abandon my lustful desire for such a woman.” He would abandon his
lustful desire for that woman. On a later occasion he might see that woman
with another man, standing together, chatting, joking and laughing. So what
do you think, O bhikkhus? “Would there arise sorrow, lamentation,
physical suffering, mental suffering and despair in such a man having seen
that woman with another man, standing together, chatting, joking and
laughing?”

<p><span class="parno">55</span>
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">56</span>
What is the reason for that?

<p><span class="parno">57</span>
“Because, O Bhante, such a man is free from lust for that
woman. Therefore having seen that woman with another man, standing together,
chatting, joking and laughing, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering,
mental suffering and despair would not arise in him.”

<p><span class="parno">58</span>
So too, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu most certainly does not cause to be an
occasion of pain for himself when the occasion has not come to be, yet he
does not forsake the pleasure that accords with the Dhamma, but he is not
infatuated with that pleasure therein. He wisely understands thus:
“[When] willfully striving, this source of suffering for me fades away
due to the willful striving. But [when] looking on with equanimity, this
source of suffering for me fades away due to the looking on with
equanimity. So indeed for him [wherein] a source of suffering fades away due
to willful striving, therein he willfully strives. [Wherein] a source of
suffering fades away due to the looking on with equanimity, therein he
develops equanimity.” Willfully striving, whichever source of
suffering fades away due to the willful striving, that fades away. Thus,
that suffering is worn away. Looking on with equanimity, whichever source of
suffering fades away due to looking on with equanimity, that fades
away. Thus, that suffering is worn away. Thus that exertion is fruitful,
that striving is fruitful.

<p><span class="parno">59</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu considers thus: “As I dwell according
to my pleasure, unwholesome dhammas increase and wholesome dhammas
diminish. However, when I engage myself in painful striving, unwholesome
dhammas diminish and wholesome dhammas increase. What if I were to engage
myself in painful striving?” He engages himself in painful
striving. For him engaging himself in painful striving, unwholesome dhammas
diminish and wholesome dhammas increase. He, on a later occasion, no longer
engages himself in painful striving. What is the reason for that? Because, O
bhikkhus, the benefit for which that bhikkhu would engage himself in painful
striving has been accomplished.Therefore on a later occasion, he no longer
engages himself in painful striving.

<p><span class="parno">60</span>
Just as, O bhikkhus, an arrowsmith would heat and scorch an arrow shaft
between two flames, making it straight and workable. Once, O bhikkhus, the
arrowsmith has heated and scorched the arrow shaft between the two flames
and made it straight and workable, on a later occasion, the arrowsmith no
longer heats and scorches the arrow shaft between the two flames to make it
straight and workable. What is the reason for that? Because, O bhikkhus, the
benefit for which that arrowsmith heated and scorched the arrow shaft
between the two flames to make it straight and workable has been
accomplished. Therefore on a later occasion, the arrowsmith no longer heats
and scorches the arrow shaft between the two flames to make it straight and
workable.

<p><span class="parno">61</span>
So too, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu considers thus: “As I dwell according to my
pleasure, unwholesome dhammas increase and wholesome dhammas
diminish. However, when I engage myself in painful striving, unwholesome
dhammas diminish and wholesome dhammas increase. What if I were to engage
myself in painful striving?” He engages himself in painful
striving. For him engaging himself in painful striving, unwholesome dhammas
diminish and wholesome dhammas increase. He, on a later occasion, no longer
engages himself in painful striving. What is the reason for that? Because, O
bhikkhus, the benefit for which that bhikkhu would engage himself in painful
striving has been accomplished. Therefore on a later occasion, he no longer
engages himself in painful striving. Thus too, that suffering is worn
away. Thus that exertion is fruitful, that striving is fruitful.

<p><span class="parno">62</span>
Furthermore O bhikkhus, here, a Tathagata arises in the world, the Arahant,
rightly self-awakened, excelling in knowledge and conduct, well-farer,
knower of the worlds, incomparable charioteer of tamed persons, teacher of
devas and humans, awakened, auspicious. Having realized this world with its
devas, maras and brahmas, together with the population of samanas and
brahmanas, devas and humans, he causes to make it known. He teaches the
Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end,
with the right meaning and phrasing, making known the life of purity that is
utterly perfect and pure. A head of household or head of household's son or
someone born in some other good family hears that Dhamma. Having heard that
Dhamma, he gains faith in the Tathagata. Being endowed with the gaining of
faith, he considers thus: “Home life is an obstruction, the domain of
dust; the going forth is as wide open as space. To live the life of purity
flawlessly, entirely complete, entirely pure, is not easily done living at
home. What if, having shaved off hair and beard, having put on the yellow
robe, I go forth from the home [life] into homelessness?” On a
later occasion, having abandoned a small or a large amount of wealth, having
abandoned a small or a large circle of relatives, having shaved off hair and
beard, having put on the yellow robe, he goes forth from the home [life]
into homelessness.

<p><span class="parno">63</span>
Being one who has gone forth thus, having undertaken the bhikkhu's training
and lifestyle, having abandoned the killing of living beings, he abstains
from the killing of living beings. Having buried the rod, having buried the
sword, he dwells conscientious, with kindness and sympathy, compassionate
for the welfare for all living beings. Having abandoned the taking of what
is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given, accepting what is
given, expecting what is given. By not thieving, he dwells having become
pure himself. Having abandoned unchastity, he is a celibate one, living
apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the villager's habit. Having
abandoned false speech, he abstains from false speech. He speaks the
truth. He is dependable, reliable, trustworthy, not a deceiver of the
world. Having abandoned divisive speech, he abstains from divisive
speech. Having heard from here, he does not tell there to divide these [from
those], or having heard from there, he does not tell here to divide those
[from these]. Thus is he, a reconciler of the divided, a bestower of
togetherness. He delights in harmony, is delighted with harmony, rejoices in
harmony, utters speech that creates harmony. Having abandoned harsh speech,
he abstains from harsh speech. That speech which is gentle, pleasant to the
ear, endearing, heartwarming, polite, pleasing to many, agreeable to many,
that form of speech he utters. Having abandoned senseless prattle, he
abstains from senseless prattle. He speaks at the proper time, [speech that
is] truthful, meaningful, in accordance with the Dhamma, in accordance with
the Vinaya, speech worth treasuring, at the proper time he utters speech
that is reasonable, speech worth remembering, speech connected with profit.

<p><span class="parno">64</span>
He abstains from injuring seed life and vegetation. He eats his meal in one
sitting, refraining from eating in the evening, abstaining from eating
outside the proper time. He abstains from dancing, singing, music and
watching shows. He abstains from the establishment of wearing adornments and
decorations with garlands, fragrances and ointments. He abstains from high
and large beds and seats. He abstains from accepting gold and silver. He
abstains from accepting uncooked grains. He abstains from accepting uncooked
meat. He abstains from accepting women and girls. He abstains from accepting
male and female slaves. He abstains from accepting goat and sheep. He
abstains from accepting chicken and pigs. He abstains from the acquisition
of elephants, cows, horses and mares. He abstains from the acquisition of
fields and lands. He abstains from the practice of going on errands and
going as a messenger. He abstains from buying and selling. He abstains from
dealing in false weighing, dealing in fake metals, dealing in false
measures, bribery, cheating and fraud. He abstains from the crooked ways of
slaughtering, imprisoning, execution and robbery. He abstains from plunder
and violence.

<p><span class="parno">65</span>
He is contented with his robes to sustain his body and alms food to sustain
his stomach. Wherever he goes, he goes having taken just these. Indeed just
as a bird with wings wherever it flies, flies with its wings as its only
burden, So too, a bhikkhu is contented with his robes to sustain his body
and alms food to sustain his stomach. Wherever he goes, he goes having taken
just these. Endowed with this noble stock of virtue, he experiences pleasure
of blamelessness internally.

<p><span class="parno">66</span>
Having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu does not grasp its sign, does not
grasp its details, since in consequence of dwelling with this eye faculty
unguarded, covetousness and longing [and] evil unwholesome dhammas might
flow on, he enters upon the path for its restraint, he protects the eye
faculty, he undertakes restraint of the eye faculty. Having heard a sound
with the ear, a bhikkhu does not grasp its sign, does not grasp its details,
since in consequence of dwelling with this ear faculty unguarded,
covetousness and longing [and] evil unwholesome dhammas might flow on, he
enters upon the path for its restraint, he protects the ear faculty, he
undertakes restraint of the ear faculty. Having smelled an aroma with the
nose, a bhikkhu does not grasp its sign, does not grasp its details, since
in consequence of dwelling with this nose faculty unguarded, covetousness
and longing [and] evil unwholesome dhammas might flow on, he enters upon the
path for its restraint, he protects the nose faculty, he undertakes
restraint of the nose faculty. Having tasted a flavor with the tongue, a
bhikkhu does not grasp its sign, does not grasp its details, since in
consequence of dwelling with this tongue faculty unguarded, covetousness and
longing [and] evil unwholesome dhammas might flow on, he enters upon the
path for its restraint, he protects the tongue faculty, he undertakes
restraint of the tongue faculty. Having touched a tangible with the body, a
bhikkhu does not grasp its sign, does not grasp its details, since in
consequence of dwelling with this body faculty unguarded, covetousness and
longing [and] evil unwholesome dhammas might flow on, he enters upon the
path for its restraint, he protects the body faculty, he undertakes
restraint of the body faculty. Having cognized a dhamma with the mind, a
bhikkhu does not grasp its sign, does not grasp its details, since in
consequence of dwelling with this mind faculty unguarded, covetousness and
longing [and] evil unwholesome dhammas might flow on, he enters upon the
path for its restraint, he protects the mind faculty, he undertakes
restraint of the mind faculty. Endowed with this noble restraint of the
sense faculties, he experiences unblemished pleasure internally.

<p><span class="parno">67</span>
He is a contemplative when stepping forwards, a contemplative when stepping
backwards, a contemplative when looking forwards, a contemplative when
looking backwards, a contemplative when bending back, a contemplative when
stretching out, a contemplative when wearing his robe and carrying his outer
robe and bowl. He is a contemplative when eating, drinking, chewing and
tasting. He is a contemplative when urinating and defecating. He is a
contemplative when going, standing, sitting, sleeping, being awake, speaking
and being silent. Endowed with this noble stock of virtue, this noble
contentment, this noble restraint of the sense faculties, and this noble
mindfulness and contemplativeness, he resorts to secluded lodging in a
wilderness, a root of a tree, a mountain glen, a hillside cave, a charnel
ground, a lonely spot in the forest, the open air, a heap of straw.

<p><span class="parno">68</span>
After his meal, having gone back after alms gathering, he sits down having
crossed his legs, having directed his body straight, having established
mindfulness on the entire field of perception [internally]. Having abandoned
covetousness in the world, he dwells with a mind free from covetousness. He
purifies his mind of covetousness. Having abandoned ill-will and aversion,
he dwells with a benevolent mind, compassionate towards all living
beings. He purifies his mind from ill-will and aversion. Having abandoned
sluggishness and lack of mental agility, he dwells with a mind free from
sluggishness and lack of mental agility, a percipient of light, mindful and
contemplative. He purifies his mind from sluggishness and lack of mental
agility. Having abandoned restlessness and remorse, he dwells with a relaxed
mind, with a mind internally tranquilized. He purifies his mind from
restlessness and remorse. Having abandoned doubt, he dwells having crossed
over doubt, free from perplexity in regard to wholesome dhammas. He purifies
his mind from doubt.

<p><span class="parno">69</span>
Having abandoned these five hindrances, defilement of the mind that weakens
wisdom, quite secluded from sense-desires, secluded from unwholesome
dhammas, he enters upon and abides in the happiness and pleasure born of
seclusion connected with thinking and pondering, the first jhana. Thus too,
O bhikkhus, that exertion is fruitful, that striving is fruitful.

<p><span class="parno">70</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, from the subsiding of thinking and pondering, with
the internal tranquilization and unification of mind [due to] the absense of
thinking and pondering, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the happiness
and pleasure born of samadhi, the second jhana. Thus too, O bhikkhus, that
exertion is fruitful, that striving is fruitful.

<p><span class="parno">71</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, with detachment from happiness, a bhikkhu dwelling
mindful and contemplative, looks on with equanimity as he experiences
pleasure in the body, of which the Noble Ones say: “He is a mindful one
who [looks on with] equanimity, one who dwells in pleasure.” He
enters upon and abides in the third jhana. Thus too, O bhikkhus, that
exertion is fruitful, that striving is fruitful.

<p><span class="parno">72</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, from the abandoning of [physical] pleasure and
pain, from the disappearance of former mental pleasure and mental pain, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the utter purity of mindfulness and
equanimity without pain and pleasure, the fourth jhana. Thus too, O
bhikkhus, that exertion is fruitful, that striving is fruitful.

<p><span class="parno">73</span>
When his samadhi is thus purified, cleansed, unblemished, devoid of
defilements, malleable, workable, steady, and attained to imperturbability,
he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past abodes. He recollects
his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four
births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births,
fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand
births, many aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of world expansion, many
aeons of world-contraction and expansion thus: “There I was so named, of
such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my
experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; and passing away from
there, I appeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of such a clan,
with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of
pleasure and pain, such my life span; and passing away from there, I
appeared here.” Thus with their aspects and particulars he
recollects his manifold past abodes. Thus too, O bhikkhus, that exertion is
fruitful, that striving is fruitful.

<p><span class="parno">74</span>
When his samadhi is thus purified, cleansed, unblemished, devoid of
defilements, malleable, workable, steady, and attained to imperturbability,
he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of
beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he
sees beings passing away and appearing, inferior and superior, beautiful and
ugly, fortunate and unfortunate. He understands how beings pass on according
to their actions thus: “These worthy beings who were ill-conducted in
body, speech, and mind, revilers of Noble Ones, wrong in their views, giving
effect to wrong view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after
death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in
perdition, even in hell; but these worthy beings who were well-conducted in
body, speech, and mind, not revilers of Noble Ones, right in their views,
giving effect to right view in their actions, on the dissolution of the
body, after death, have reappeared in a good destination, even in the
heavenly world.” Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and
surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and appearing, inferior and
superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands
how beings pass on according to their actions. Thus too, O bhikkhus, that
exertion is fruitful, that striving is fruitful.

<p><span class="parno">75</span>
When his samadhi is thus purified, cleansed, unblemished, devoid of
defilements, malleable, workable, steady, and attained to imperturbability,
he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the asavas. He understands
as it has come to be: “This is suffering”; he understands as it
has come to be: “This is the origin of suffering”; he
understands as it has come to be: “This is the cessation of
suffering”; he understands as it has come to be: “This is the
way leading to the cessation of suffering.” He understands as it
has come to be: “These are the asavas”; he understands as it has
come to be: “This is the origin of the asavas”; he understands
as it has come to be: “This is the cessation of the asavas”; he
understands as it has come to be: “This is the way leading to the
cessation of the asavas.” When he knows and sees thus, his mind is
liberated from the asava of sensual desire, from the asava of being, and
from the asava of ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge:
“It is liberated.” He understands: “Birth is destroyed, the
holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no
other for thusness.” Thus too, O bhikkhus, that exertion is
fruitful, that striving is fruitful.

<p><span class="parno">76</span>
Thus is the doctrine of the Tathagata, O bhikkhus. Thus being the doctrine
of the Tathagata, O bhikkhus, there are ten grounds for praise in accordance
with the Dhamma. If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and pain that beings
experience are caused by what was done in the past, then certainly, O
bhikkhus, the Tathagata has done good kamma in the past, in that at present,
he feels such asava-free pleasant feelings. If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and
pain that beings experience are caused by a god's creation, then certainly,
O bhikkhus, the Tathagata has been created by a good god, in that at
present, he feels such asava-free pleasant feelings. If, O bhikkhus, the
pleasure and pain that beings experience are caused by a chance encounter,
then certainly, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata has good luck, in that at present,
he feels such asava-free pleasant feelings. If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and
pain that beings experience are caused by social class, then certainly, O
bhikkhus, the Tathagata belongs to a good social class, in that at present,
he feels such asava-free pleasant feelings. If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and
pain that beings experience are caused by striving in this life, then
certainly, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata strives well in this life, in that at
present, he feels such asava-free pleasant feelings.

<p><span class="parno">77</span>
“If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and pain that beings experience are caused
by what was done in the past, the Tathagata is to be praised. If the
pleasure and pain that beings experience are not caused by what was done in
the past, the Tathagata is to be praised. If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and
pain that beings experience are caused by a god's creation, the Tathagata is
to be praised. If the pleasure and pain that beings experience are not
caused by a god's creation, the Tathagata is to be praised. If, O bhikkhus,
the pleasure and pain that beings experience are caused by a chance
encounter, the Tathagata is to be praised. If the pleasure and pain that
beings experience are not caused by a chance encounter, the Tathagata is to
be praised. If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and pain that beings experience are
caused by social class, the Tathagata is to be praised. If the pleasure and
pain that beings experience are not caused by social class, the Tathagata is
to be praised. If, O bhikkhus, the pleasure and pain that beings experience
are caused by striving in this life, the Tathagata is to be praised. If the
pleasure and pain that beings experience are not caused by striving in this
life, the Tathagata is to be praised. Thus being the doctrine of the
Tathagata, O bhikkhus, these are the ten grounds for praise in accordance
with the Dhamma.”

<p><span class="parno">78</span>
This is what the Auspicious One said. Delighted, those bhikkhus rejoiced in
the Auspicious One's words.
