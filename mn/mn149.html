Thus was heard by me: At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling in
Savatthi at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. At that place the Auspicious
One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.” “Bhante,”
those bhikkhus replied to the Auspicious One. The Auspicious One said this:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“The great six [sense] domains, O bhikkhus, I will expound for
you. Listen to that and do mind it well, I will speak.”.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“Yes Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied to the Auspicious One. The
Auspicious One said this:

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
O bhikkhus, one who does not know and does not see the eye as it has come to
be, one who does not know and does not see forms as they have come to be,
one who does not know and does not see eye-consciousness as it has come to
be, one who does not know and does not see eye-contact as it has come to be,
and this feeling which arises in dependence on eye-contact, whether pleasant
or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too one who does not know
and does not see it as it has come to be, becomes pleased in the eye,
becomes pleased in forms, becomes pleased in eye-consciousness, becomes
pleased in eye-contact, and this feeling which arises in dependence on
eye-contact, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant,
that too one becomes pleased in it.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
And for he who abides impassioned, attached, oblivious, seeing in accordance
with gratification, his five stocks of appropriation go to expansion for
future [being]; and his thirst—the renewer of being, accompanied by delight
and lust, delighting now here now there—increases. His bodily stresses
increase, his mental stresses increase, his bodily torments increase, his
mental torments increase, his bodily fevers increase, his mental fevers
increase, and he experiences bodily and mental suffering.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
O bhikkhus, one who does not know and does not see the ear as it has come to
be, one who does not know and does not see sounds as they have come to be,
one who does not know and does not see ear-consciousness as it has come to
be, one who does not know and does not see ear-contact as it has come to be,
and this feeling which arises in dependence on ear-contact, whether pleasant
or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too one who does not know

becomes pleased in sounds, becomes pleased in ear-consciousness, becomes
pleased in ear-contact, and this feeling which arises in dependence on
ear-contact, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant,
that too one becomes pleased in it.

O bhikkhus, one who does not know and does not see the nose as it has come
to be, one who does not know and does not see aromas as they have come to
be, one who does not know and does not see nose-consciousness as it has come
to be, one who does not know and does not see nose-contact as it has come to
be, and this feeling which arises in dependence on nose-contact, whether
pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too one who does
not know and does not see it as it has come to be, also becomes pleased in
the nose, becomes pleased in aromas, becomes pleased in nose-consciousness,
becomes pleased in nose-contact, and this feeling which arises in dependence

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
O bhikkhus, one who does not know and does not see the tongue as it has come
to be, one who does not know and does not see flavours as they have come to
be, one who does not know and does not see tongue-consciousness as it has
come to be, one who does not know and does not see tongue-contact as it has
come to be, and this feeling which arises in dependence on tongue-contact,
whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too one
who does not know and does not see it as it has come to be, also becomes
pleased in the tongue, becomes pleased in flavours, becomes pleased in
tongue-consciousness, becomes pleased in tongue-contact, and this feeling
which arises in dependence on tongue-contact, whether pleasant or painful or

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
O bhikkhus, one who does not know and does not see the body as it has come
to be, one who does not know and does not see tangibles as they have come to
be, one who does not know and does not see body-consciousness as it has come
to be, one who does not know and does not see body-contact as it has come to
be, and this feeling which arises in dependence on body-contact, whether
pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too one who does

the body, becomes pleased in tangibles, becomes pleased in

mental torments increase, his bodily fevers increase, his mental fevers

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
O bhikkhus, one who does not know and does not see the mind as it has come
to be, one who does not know and does not see dhammas as they have come to
be, one who does not know and does not see mind-consciousness as it has come
to be, one who does not know and does not see mind-contact as it has come to
be, and this feeling which arises in dependence on mind-contact, whether
pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too one who does
not know and does not see it as it has come to be, also becomes pleased in
the mind, becomes pleased in dhammas, becomes pleased in mind-consciousness,
becomes pleased in mind-contact, and this feeling which arises in dependence
on mind-contact, whether pleasant or painful or
neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too one becomes pleased in it.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
And for he who abides impassioned, attached, oblivious, seeing in accordance
with gratification, his five stocks of appropriation go to expansion for

increase, his mental stresses increase, his bodily torments increase, his
mental torments increase, his bodily fevers increase, his mental fevers

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
But O bhikkhus, one who knows and sees the eye as it has come to be, one who
knows and sees forms as they have come to be, one who knows and sees
eye-consciousness as it has come to be, one who knows and sees eye-contact
as it has come to be, and this feeling which arises in dependence on
eye-contact, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant,
that too one who knows and sees it as it has come to be, does not become
pleased in the eye, does not become pleased in forms, does not become
pleased in eye-consciousness, does not become pleased in eye-contact, and
this feeling which arises in dependence on eye-contact, whether pleasant or
painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too one does not become
pleased in it.

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
And for he who abides passionless, unattached, mindful, seeing in accordance
with liability, his five stocks of appropriation go to depletion for future
[being]; and his thirst—the renewer of being, accompanied by delight and
lust, delighting now here now there—is abandoned. His bodily stresses are
abandoned, his mental stresses are abandoned, his bodily torments are
abandoned, his mental torments are abandoned, his bodily fevers are
abandoned, his mental fevers are abandoned, and he experiences bodily and
mental pleasure.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>

such effort, that is his right effort. He who has come to be of such
mindfulness, that is his right mindfulness. He who has come to be of such
samadhi, that is his right samadhi. But his bodily actions, verbal actions
and livelihood are well purified just earlier. Thus, of him, this noble
eight-fold path goes to full maturation.

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
From his maturation of the noble eight-fold path, the four establishments of
mindfulness also go to full maturation. The four right strivings also go to
full maturation. The four bases for psychic powers also go to full
maturation. The five faculties also go to full maturation. The five powers
also go to full maturation. The seven awakening factors also go to full
maturation.

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
Of him these two dhammas turn yoked together: samatha and vipassana. He
comprehensively knows by higher knowledge those dhammas that should be

those dhammas that should be abandoned by higher knowledge. He brings into
being by higher knowledge those dhammas that should be brought into being by
higher knowledge. He realizes by higher knowledge those dhammas that should
be realized by higher knowledge.

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, are the dhammas that should be comprehensively known
by higher knowledge? It should be said, the five stocks of
appropriation. That is: the form stock of appropriation, the feeling stock
of appropriation, the perception stock of appropriation, the sankharas stock
of appropriation, the consciousness stock of appropriation. These are the
dhammas that should be comprehensively known by higher knowledge.

<p><span class="parno">22</span>

And what, O bhikkhus, are the dhammas that should be realized by higher
knowledge? noble knowledge and liberation. These are the dhammas that should
be realized by higher knowledge.

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
O bhikkhus, one who knows and sees the ear as it has come to be, one who
knows and sees sounds as they have come to be, one who knows and sees
ear-consciousness as it has come to be, one who knows and sees ear-contact
as it has come to be, and this feeling which arises in dependence on
ear-contact, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant,
that too one who knows and sees it as it has come to be, also does not
become pleased in the ear, does not become pleased in sounds, does not
become pleased in ear-consciousness, does not become pleased in ear-contact,
and this feeling which arises in dependence on ear-contact, whether pleasant
or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too one does not become

And what, O bhikkhus, are the dhammas that should be realized by higher
knowledge? noble knowledge and liberation. These are the dhammas that should
be realized by higher knowledge.

<p><span class="parno">52</span>
O bhikkhus, one who knows and sees the body as it has come to be, one who
knows and sees tangibles as they have come to be, one who knows and sees
body-consciousness as it has come to be, one who knows and sees body-contact
as it has come to be, and this feeling which arises in dependence on
body-contact, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant,
that too one who knows and sees it as it has come to be, also does not
become pleased in the body, does not become pleased in tangibles, does not
become pleased in body-consciousness, does not become pleased in
body-contact, and this feeling which arises in dependence on body-contact,
whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too one
does not become pleased in it.

<p><span class="parno">53</span>
And for he who abides passionless, unattached, mindful, seeing in accordance
with liability, his five stocks of appropriation go to depletion for future
[being]; and his thirst—the renewer of being, accompanied by delight and
lust, delighting now here now there—is abandoned. His bodily stresses are
abandoned, his mental stresses are abandoned, his bodily torments are
abandoned, his mental torments are abandoned, his bodily fevers are
abandoned, his mental fevers are abandoned, and he experiences bodily and
mental pleasure.

<p><span class="parno">54</span>
He who has come to be of such view, that is his right view. He who has come
to be of such thought, that is his right thought. He who has come to be of
such effort, that is his right effort. He who has come to be of such
mindfulness, that is his right mindfulness. He who has come to be of such
samadhi, that is his right samadhi. But his bodily actions, verbal actions
and livelihood are well purified just earlier. Thus, of him, this noble
eight-fold path goes to full maturation.

<p><span class="parno">55</span>
From his maturation of the noble eight-fold path, the four establishments of
mindfulness also go to full maturation. The four right strivings also go to
full maturation. The four bases for psychic powers also go to full
maturation. The five faculties also go to full maturation. The five powers
also go to full maturation. The seven awakening factors also go to full
maturation.

<p><span class="parno">56</span>
Of him these two dhammas turn yoked together: samatha and vipassana. He
comprehensively knows by higher knowledge those dhammas that should be
comprehensively known by higher knowledge. He abandons by higher knowledge
those dhammas that should be abandoned by higher knowledge. He brings into
being by higher knowledge those dhammas that should be brought into being by
higher knowledge. He realizes by higher knowledge those dhammas that should
be realized by higher knowledge.

<p><span class="parno">57</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, are the dhammas that should be comprehensively known
by higher knowledge? It should be said, the five stocks of
appropriation. That is: the form stock of appropriation, the feeling stock
of appropriation, the perception stock of appropriation, the sankharas stock
of appropriation, the consciousness stock of appropriation. These are the
dhammas that should be comprehensively known by higher knowledge.

<p><span class="parno">58</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, are the dhammas that should be abandoned by higher
knowledge? ignorance and thirst for being. These are the dhammas that should
be abandoned by higher knowledge.

knows and sees dhammas as they have come to be, one who knows and sees
mind-consciousness as it has come to be, one who knows and sees mind-contact
as it has come to be, and this feeling which arises in dependence on
mind-contact, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant,
that too one who knows and sees it as it has come to be, also does not
become pleased in the mind, does not become pleased in dhammas, does not
become pleased in mind-consciousness, does not become pleased in
mind-contact, and this feeling which arises in dependence on mind-contact,
whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that too one
