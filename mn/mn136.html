<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling in
Rajagaha at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel's feeding place. At that time the
venerable Samiddhi was a forest hut dweller.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Now Potaliputta, the wanderer, who was walking and wandering about, walking
along back and forth, stopped by the venerable Samiddhi. Upon arrival, he
exchanged friendly greetings with the venerable Samiddhi. Having exchanged
friendly greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side. Having sat
down to one side, Potaliputta, the wanderer, said this to the venerable
Samiddhi: “ In the presence of the samana Gotama, O friend Samiddhi, this
was heard by me, received by me in his presence. “Bodily kamma is empty,
verbal kamma is empty, only mental kamma is true.” “And there is
an attainment whereby one who has entered upon that attainment does not feel
anything.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Let it not be said thus, O friend Potaliputta, let it not be said thus, O
friend Potaliputta. Let the Auspicious One not be misrepresented, for indeed
misrepresenting the Auspicious One is not good. The Auspicious One would
definately not say thus: “Bodily kamma is empty, verbal kamma is empty,
only mental kamma is true.” “And there is an attainment, O
friend, whereby one who has entered upon that attainment does not feel
anything.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
“How long has it been, O friend Samiddhi, since you went forth?”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“Not long, O friend, three years.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
“Here now, what should we say to elder bhikkhus where a new bhikkhu
thinks the Teacher should be defended thus. Having done an intentional kamma
by body, speech or mind, O friend Samiddhi, what does one
experience?”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
“Having done an intentional kamma by body, speech or mind, O friend
Potaliputta, one experiences suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Then Potaliputta, the wanderer, neither delighted in nor rejected the
venerable Samiddhi's statement. Having not delighted in, having not
rejected, having risen up from his seat, he departed.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Then the venerable Samiddhi, not long after Potaliputta, the wanderer had
left, approached the venerable Ananda. Upon arrival, he exchanged friendly
greetings with the venerable Ananda. Having exchanged friendly greetings and
cordial talk, he sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the
venerable Samiddhi informed the venerable Ananda the full extent of his
friendly conversation with Potaliputta, the wanderer. When thus was said,
the venerable Ananda said this to the venerable samiddhi: “This subject
of conversation, O friend Samiddhi, is indeed worth seeing the Auspicious
One and telling him. We must visit with the Auspicious One, O friend
Samiddhi. Upon arrival, we must inform the Auspicious One of this matter. In
which ever way the Auspicious One will answer, in just that way we must bear
it in mind.”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
“Yes, O friend,” the venerable Samiddhi assented to the
venerable Ananda. So then, the venerable Ananda and the venerable Samiddhi
visited with the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, having paid respects to the
Auspicious One, they sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the
venerable Ananda informed the Auspicious One the full extent of the
venerable Samiddhi's conversation with Potaliputta, the wanderer.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
When thus was said, the Auspicious One said this to the venerable
Ananda. “I, O Ananda, do not even recall seeing Potaliputta, the
wanderer, so how could there have been such a conversation. But O Ananda,
this empty man Samiddhi answered Potaliputta, the wanderer's question
categorically when [it is a question] to be answered after making a
distinction.”

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
When thus was said, the venerable Udayi said this to the Auspicious
One. “But Bhante, perhaps the venerable Samiddhi answered with reference
to this statement: Whatever is felt, all that is [included] in
suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
Then the Auspicious One addressed the venerable Ananda. “Do you see, O
Ananda, [how] this empty man Udayi [has deduced] in the wrong way? I knew
just now, O Ananda, that this empty man Udayi, while deducing will deduce
without root reason consideration. From the very start, O Ananda,
Potaliputta, the wanderer, asked about the threefold feeling. If, O Ananda,
this empty man Samiddhi when asked by Potaliputta, the wanderer, would have
answered thus: “Having done an intentional kamma to be felt as pleasure
by body, speech or mind, O friend Potaliputta, one experiences
pleasure.” “Having done an intentional kamma to be felt as pain
by body, speech or mind, O friend Potaliputta, one experiences
pain.” “Having done an intentional kamma to be felt as neither
pain nor pleasure by body, speech or mind, O friend Potaliputta, one
experiences neither pain nor pleasure.” Answering thus, O Ananda,
the empty man Samiddhi would have answered Potaliputta, the wanderer,
rightly. But, O Ananda, who are those foolish and incompetent wanderers of
other standpoints, that they will understand the Tathagata's great
classification of kamma. If you, O Ananda, would listen, the Tathagata will
analyze the great classification of kamma.”

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
“This is the appropriate time, O Auspicious One, this is the appropriate
time, O Well-farer, the Auspicious One should analyze the great
classification of kamma. Having heard from the Auspicious One, the bhikkhus
will bear it in mind.”

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
“Well then, O Ananda, listen and do mind it well. I will speak.”

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
Yes, Bhante, the venerable Ananda assented to the Auspicious One. The
Auspicious One said this:

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
These four individuals, O Ananda, are to be found existing in the
world. What four? Here, O Ananda, a certain individual in this world is a
killer of living beings, a taker of what is not given, an engager in
misconduct in sensual pleasures, a speaker of falsehood, a speaker of
divisive speech, a speaker of harsh speech, a covetous one, one with a mind
of ill-will, a holder of wrong view and distorted vision. He arises in a
lower world, unhappy destination, the woeful plane, in hell, whith the
body's breakup after death.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
But here, O Ananda, a certain individual in this world is a killer of living
beings, a taker of what is not given, an engager in misconduct in sensual
pleasures, a speaker of falsehood, a speaker of divisive speech, a speaker
of harsh speech, a covetous one, one with a mind of ill-will, a holder of
wrong view and distorted vision. He arises in a happy state, in the heavenly
world, with the body's breakup after death.

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
Here, O Ananda, a certain individual in this world is an abstainer from the
killing of living beings, an abstainer from taking what is not given, an
abstainer from misconduct in sensual pleasures, an abstainer from false
speech, an abstainer from divisive speech, an abstainer from harsh speech,
an abstainer from senseless prattle, is not covetous, does not have a mind
of ill-will, is a holder of right view and undistorted vision. He arises in
a happy state, in the heavenly world, with the body's breakup after death.

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
But here, O Ananda, a certain individual in this world is an abstainer from
the killing of living beings, an abstainer from taking what is not given, an
abstainer from misconduct in sensual pleasures, an abstainer from false
speech, an abstainer from divisive speech, an abstainer from harsh speech,
an abstainer from senseless prattle, is not covetous, does not have a mind
of ill-will, is a holder of right view and undistorted vision. He arises in
a lower world, unhappy destination, the woeful plane, in hell, with the
body's breakup after death.

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
Now here, O Ananda, a certain samana or brahmana, in consequence of ardour,
in consequence of endeavour, in consequence of application, in consequence
of vigilance, in consequence of right attention, mentally touches a type of
samadhi by which in that state of mind, with the divine eye which is
purified and surpasses the human, he sees that such an individual in this
world: a killer of living beings, a taker of what is not given, an engager
in misconduct in sensual pleasures, a speaker of falsehood, a speaker of
divisive speech, a speaker of harsh speech, a covetous one, one with a mind
of ill-will, a holder of wrong view and distorted vision, has arisen in a
lower world, unhappy destination, the woeful plane, in hell, with the body's
breakup after death. He says thus: 'Indeed sir, there is evil kamma, there
is the result of bad conduct. For I see that individual in this world: a
killer of living beings, a taker of what is not given, an engager in
misconduct in sensual pleasures, a speaker of falsehood, a speaker of
divisive speech, a speaker of harsh speech, a covetous one, one with a mind
of ill-will, a holder of wrong view and distorted vision, has arisen in a
lower world, unhappy destination, the woeful plane, in hell, with the body's
breakup after death. So he says thus: Truly sir, whoever is a killer of
living beings, a taker of what is not given, an engager in misconduct in
sensual pleasures, a speaker of falsehood, a speaker of divisive speech, a
speaker of harsh speech, a covetous one, one with a mind of ill-will, a
holder of wrong view and distorted vision, all arise in a lower world,
unhappy destination, the woeful plane, in hell, with the body's breakup
after death. Those who know thus, they know rightly. Those who know
otherwise, they have wrong knowledge. Thus, he obstinately adheres to only
that which he has just known by himself, seen by himself, understood by
himself, and asserts: “Only this is the truth, otherwise is
false.”

says thus: 'Indeed sir, there is not evil kamma, there is not the result of
bad conduct. For I see that individual in this world: a killer of living

wrong view and distorted vision, has arisen in a happy state, in the
heavenly world, with the body's breakup after death. So he says thus: Truly
sir, whoever is a killer of living beings, a taker of what is not given, one
who misconduct in sensual pleasures, a speaker of falsehood, a speaker of
divisive speech, a speaker of harsh speech, a covetous one, one with a mind
of ill-will, a holder of wrong view and distorted vision, all arise in a

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
Therein, O Ananda, the samana or brahmana who says thus: 'Indeed sir, there

breakup after death, I do not grant him this. Also he who says thus: Those
who know thus, they know rightly. Those who know otherwise, they have wrong
knowledge, I do not grant him this also. Also he who obstinately adheres to
just what he has known by himself, seen by himself, understood by himself,
and asserts thus: “Only this is the truth, otherwise is false,”
I do not grant him this also. What is the reason for that? Because, O
Ananda, the Tathagata's knowledge of the great classification of kamma is
otherwise.

Thus, O Ananda, there is kamma that is incapable [of good results] and
appears incapable. There is kamma that is incapable [of good results] but
appears capable. But indeed, there is kamma that is truly capable [of good
