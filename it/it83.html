This indeed was said by the Auspicious One, said by the Arahant, as heard by
me:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
When, O bhikkhus, a deva from the deva group is due to pass away, five
foretelling signs becomes manifest: “His flower garland withers; his
garment becomes soiled; sweat is released from his armpit; his body loses
radiance, the deva does not delight in his own deva's throne.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
To him, O bhikkhus, devas having known: “This son of the devas is due to
pass away,” rejoice in [his opportunity] with three sayings: “Go
Sir, from here to a good-borne. Having gone to a good-borne, gain that gain
which is good to gain. Having gained that gain which is good to gain, become
firmly established in it.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
When thus was said, a certain bhikkhu said this to the Auspicious One:
“What, O Bhante, do the devas reckon as going to a good-borne? And what,
O Bhante, do the devas reckon as a gain that is good to gain? Moreover,
what, O Bhante, do the devas reckon as being firmly established?”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“Human birth, O bhikkhu, is what the devas reckon as going to a
good-borne. When a human being gains faith in the Dhamma and Vinaya declared
by the Tathagata, this, O bhikkhu, is what the devas reckon as gain that is
good to gain. When that faith becomes ever so settled, rooted, established,
steady, immoveable by any samana, or by any brahmana, or by any deva, or by
any Mara, or by any Brahma in the world, this, O bhikkhu, is what the devas
reckon as firmly established.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
This is the meaning of what the Auspicious One said. Thus, this was said
there:

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “When a deva from the deva group,<br> passes away from the exhaustion of
life;<br> three sounds are uttered forth,<br> the rejoicing of the devas.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   From here go to a good borne,<br> the companionship of humans;<br> having come
to be a human [and encountered] the true Dhamma,<br> gain that unsurpassed
faith.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   That faith which is settled,<br> rooted, established;<br> in the well proclaimed
true Dhamma,<br> unshakable as long as there is life.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   Having abandoned bad bodily conduct,<br> and bad verbal conduct;<br> having
abandoned bad mental conduct,<br> [and] whichever other [conduct] that is
reckoned as a fault.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   Having done [what is] wholesome by the body,<br> [and] much that is wholesome
by speech;<br> having done [what is] wholesome by the mind,<br> boundless
without appropriations.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   From that merit partaking in appropriations,<br> having made by giving to that
able one;<br> also to a man [possessed of] final knowledge in the true
Dhamma,<br> having been established in the life of purity.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   Having this compassion,<br> when a deva is due to pass away;<br> devas who are
wise rejoice in [his opportunity],<br> come deva again and again.”
