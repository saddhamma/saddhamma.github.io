This indeed was said by the Auspicious One, said by the Arahant, as heard by
me:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
These three individuals, O bhikkhus, arising in the world, arise for the
welfare of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world,
for the good, welfare and happiness of devas and humans. Which three?

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata, the Arahant, the rightly self-awakened one,
excelling in knowledge and conduct, well-farer, knower of worlds,
incomparable trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans,
awakened, auspicious. He teaches the Dhamma that is auspicious in the
beginning, auspicious in the middle, auspicious in the end, with the right
meaning and phrasing, making known the life of purity that is utterly
perfect and pure. This, O bhikkhus, is the first individual arising in the
world who arises for the welfare of many, for the happiness of many, out of
compassion for the world, for the good, welfare and happiness of devas and
humans.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, there is also that Teacher's disciple who is an
arahant with asavas destroyed, one who has lived [the life of purity], done
what must be done, laid down the burden, attained the true advantage,
completely destroyed the fetters of being, one who is liberated by right
final knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma that is auspicious in the beginning,
auspicious in the middle, auspicious in the end, with the right meaning and
phrasing, making known the life of purity that is utterly perfect and
pure. This, O bhikkhus, is the second individual arising in the world who
arises for the welfare of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion
for the world, for the good, welfare and happiness of devas and humans.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Furthermore, O bhikkhus, there is also that Teacher's disciple, a sekha,
following the way, one of much learning, accomplished in virtue. He teaches
the Dhamma that is auspicious in the beginning, auspicious in the middle,
auspicious in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, making known the
life of purity that is utterly perfect and pure. This, O bhikkhus, is the
third individual arising in the world who arises for the welfare of many,
for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the good,
welfare and happiness of devas and humans.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
This is the meaning of what the Auspicious One said. Thus, this was said
there:

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   1. “Indeed the Teacher, the great sage, is first in the world,<br> [then]
there is his disciple, one attained to self-composure;<br> then another too is
the sekha, following the way,<br> one of great learning, accomplished in
virtue.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   2. These three are the foremost among devas and humans,<br> luminaries, they
cause the Dhamma to appear;<br> they open the door to the deathless, <br>
causing to free many people from bondage.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   3. Those who follow the path,<br> well taught by the unsurpassed caravan
leader;<br> only they will make an end of suffering in this world,<br> those who
are vigilant in the Well-farer's instructions.”
</p>
