<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. At that place the Auspicious
One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.” “Bhante,”
those bhikkhus replied to the Auspicious One. The Auspicious One said this:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“To what extent, O bhikkhus, should a bhikkhu who is thoroughly
investigating, rightly investigate for the obliteration of all
suffering?” The Auspicious One O Bhante, is the root of the Dhamma
for us, the Auspicious One is the guide, the Auspicious One is the
refuge. Certainly, please let the meaning of this statement be only evident
to the Auspicious One. Having heard of this [from] the Auspicious One, the
bhikkhus will bear it in mind.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“Well then, O bhikkhus, listen and do mind it well. I will
speak.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
“Yes Bhante.” Those bhikkhus replied to the Auspicious One. The
Auspicious One said this:

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“This, O bhikkhus, is how a bhikkhu who is thoroughly investigating,
investigates: The diverse and numerous kinds of sufferings which arise here
in the world [including] old age and death, what is this suffering's source,
what is its origin, from what is it born, from what does it arise, when
there is what within does old age and death come to be, when there is not
what within does old age and death not come to be?”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Thoroughly investigating, he wisely understands thus: “The diverse and
numerous kinds of sufferings which arise here in the world [including] old
age and death, this suffering has birth as its source, birth as its origin,
it is born from birth, it arises from birth; when there is birth within, old
age and death come to be, when there is not birth within, old age and death
does not come to be.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
He wisely understands old age and death, and he wisely understands the
origination of old age and death, and he wisely understands the cessation of
old age and death, and that which is the path that properly leads to the
cessation of old age and death, that too he wisely understands. So he has
entered upon the path and is one whose conduct accords with the
Dhamma. This, O bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu  who has entered upon the
right path for the obliteration of all suffering, for the cessation of old
age and death.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Thoroughly investigating further, he investigates: “But this birth, what
is its source, what is its origin, from what is it born, from what does it
arise, when there is what within does birth comes to be, when there is not
what within does birth not come to be?”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Thoroughly investigating, he wisely understands thus: “Birth has being as
its source, being as its origin, it is born from being, it arises from
being; when there is being within, birth comes to be, when there is not
being within, birth does not come to be.”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
He wisely understands birth, and he wisely understands the origination of
birth, and he wisely understands the cessation of birth, and that which is
the path that properly leads to the cessation of birth, that too he wisely
understands. So he has entered upon the path and is one whose conduct
accords with the Dhamma. This, O bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu  who has
entered upon the right path for the obliteration of all suffering, for the
cessation of birth.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
Thoroughly investigating further, he investigates: “But this being, what
is its source, what is its origin, from what is it born, from what does it
arise, when there is what within does being comes to be, when there is not
what within does being not come to be?”

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
Thoroughly investigating, he wisely understands thus: “Being has
undertaking as its source, undertaking as its origin, it is born from
undertaking, it arises from undertaking; when there is undertaking within,
being comes to be, when there is not undertaking within, being does not come
to be.”

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
He wisely understands being, and he wisely understands the origination of
being, and he wisely understands the cessation of being, and that which is
the path that properly leads to the cessation of being, that too he wisely
understands. So he has entered upon the path and is one whose conduct
accords with the Dhamma. This, O bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu  who has
entered upon the right path for the obliteration of all suffering, for the
cessation of being.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
Thoroughly investigating further, he investigates: “But this undertaking,
what is its source, what is its origin, from what is it born, from what does
it arise, when there is what within does undertaking comes to be, when there
is not what within does undertaking not come to be?”

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
Thoroughly investigating, he wisely understands thus: “undertaking has
thirsting as its source, thirsting as its origin, it is born from thirsting,
it arises from thirsting; when there is thirsting within, undertaking comes
to be, when there is not thirsting within, undertaking does not come to
be.”

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
He wisely understands undertaking, and he wisely understands the origination
of undertaking, and he wisely understands the cessation of undertaking, and
that which is the path that properly leads to the cessation of undertaking,
that too he wisely understands. So he has entered upon the path and is one
whose conduct accords with the Dhamma. This, O bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu
who has entered upon the right path for the obliteration of all suffering,
for the cessation of undertaking.

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
Thoroughly investigating further, he investigates: “But this thirsting,
what is its source, what is its origin, from what is it born, from what does
it arise, when there is what within does thirsting comes to be, when there
is not what within does thirsting not come to be?”

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
Thoroughly investigating, he wisely understands thus: “thirsting has
feeling as its source, feeling as its origin, it is born from feeling, it
arises from feeling; when there is feeling within, thirsting comes to be,
when there is not feeling within, thirsting does not come to be.”

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
He wisely understands thirsting, and he wisely understands the origination
of thirsting, and he wisely understands the cessation of thirsting, and that
which is the path that properly leads to the cessation of thirsting, that
too he wisely understands. So he has entered upon the path and is one whose
conduct accords with the Dhamma. This, O bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu  who
has entered upon the right path for the obliteration of all suffering, for
the cessation of thirsting.

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
Thoroughly investigating further, he investigates: “But this feeling,
what is its source, what is its origin, from what is it born, from what does
it arise, when there is what within does feeling comes to be, when there is
not what within does feeling not come to be?”

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
Thoroughly investigating, he wisely understands thus: “feeling has
contact as its source, contact as its origin, it is born from contact, it
arises from contact; when there is contact within, feeling comes to be, when
there is not contact within, feeling does not come to be.”

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
He wisely understands feeling, and he wisely understands the origination of
feeling, and he wisely understands the cessation of feeling, and that which
is the path that properly leads to the cessation of feeling, that too he
wisely understands. So he has entered upon the path and is one whose conduct
accords with the Dhamma. This, O bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu  who has
entered upon the right path for the obliteration of all suffering, for the
cessation of feeling.

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
Thoroughly investigating further, he investigates: “But this contact,
what is its source, what is its origin, from what is it born, from what does
it arise, when there is what within does contact comes to be, when there is
not what within does contact not come to be?”

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
Thoroughly investigating, he wisely understands thus: “contact has the
six-sense domain as its source, the six-sense domain as its origin, it is
born from the six-sense domain, it arises from the six-sense domain; when
there is the six-sense domain within, contact comes to be, when there is not
the six-sense domain within, contact does not come to be.”

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
He wisely understands contact, and he wisely understands the origination of
contact, and he wisely understands the cessation of contact, and that which
is the path that properly leads to the cessation of contact, that too he
wisely understands. So he has entered upon the path and is one whose conduct
accords with the Dhamma. This, O bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu  who has
entered upon the right path for the obliteration of all suffering, for the
cessation of contact.

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
Thoroughly investigating further, he investigates: “But this six-sense
domain, what is its source, what is its origin, from what is it born, from
what does it arise, when there is what within does the six-sense domain
comes to be, when there is not what within does the six-sense domain not
come to be?”

<p><span class="parno">27</span>
Thoroughly investigating, he wisely understands thus: “the six-sense
domain has name-and-form as its source, name-and-form as its origin, it is
born from name-and-form, it arises from name-and-form; when there is
name-and-form within, the six-sense domain comes to be, when there is not
name-and-form within, the six-sense domain does not come to be.”

<p><span class="parno">28</span>
He wisely understands the six-sense domain, and he wisely understands the
origination of the six-sense domain, and he wisely understands the cessation
of the six-sense domain, and that which is the path that properly leads to
the cessation of the six-sense domain, that too he wisely understands. So he
has entered upon the path and is one whose conduct accords with the
Dhamma. This, O bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu  who has entered upon the
right path for the obliteration of all suffering, for the cessation of the
six-sense domain.

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
Thoroughly investigating further, he investigates: “But this
name-and-form, what is its source, what is its origin, from what is it born,
from what does it arise, when there is what within does name-and-form comes
to be, when there is not what within does name-and-form not come to
be?”

<p><span class="parno">30</span>
Thoroughly investigating, he wisely understands thus: “name-and-form has
consciousness as its source, consciousness as its origin, it is born from
consciousness, it arises from consciousness; when there is consciousness
within, name-and-form comes to be, when there is not consciousness within,
name-and-form does not come to be.”

<p><span class="parno">31</span>
He wisely understands name-and-form, and he wisely understands the
origination of name-and-form, and he wisely understands the cessation of
name-and-form, and that which is the path that properly leads to the
cessation of name-and-form, that too he wisely understands. So he has
entered upon the path and is one whose conduct accords with the
Dhamma. This, O bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu  who has entered upon the
right path for the obliteration of all suffering, for the cessation of
name-and-form.

<p><span class="parno">32</span>
Thoroughly investigating further, he investigates: “But this
consciousness, what is its source, what is its origin, from what is it born,
from what does it arise, when there is what within does consciousness comes
to be, when there is not what within does consciousness not come to
be?”

<p><span class="parno">33</span>
Thoroughly investigating, he wisely understands thus: “consciousness has
sankhara as its source, sankhara as its origin, it is born from sankhara, it
arises from sankhara; when there is sankhara within, consciousness comes to
be, when there is not sankhara within, consciousness does not come to
be.”

<p><span class="parno">34</span>
He wisely understands consciousness, and he wisely understands the
origination of consciousness, and he wisely understands the cessation of
consciousness, and that which is the path that properly leads to the
cessation of consciousness, that too he wisely understands. So he has
entered upon the path and is one whose conduct accords with the
Dhamma. This, O bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu  who has entered upon the
right path for the obliteration of all suffering, for the cessation of
consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">35</span>
Thoroughly investigating further, he investigates: “But this sankhara,
what is its source, what is its origin, from what is it born, from what does
it arise, when there is what within does sankhara comes to be, when there is
not what within does sankhara not come to be?”

<p><span class="parno">36</span>
Thoroughly investigating, he wisely understands thus: “sankharas have
ignorance as their source, ignorance as their origin, they are born from
ignorance, they arise from ignorance; when there is ignorance within,
sankharas come to be, when there is not ignorance within, sankharas do not
come to be.”

<p><span class="parno">37</span>
He wisely understands sankhara, and he wisely understands the origination of
sankhara, and he wisely understands the cessation of sankhara, and that
which is the path that properly leads to the cessation of sankhara, that too
he wisely understands. So he has entered upon the path and is one whose
conduct accords with the Dhamma. This, O bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu  who
has entered upon the right path for the obliteration of all suffering, for
the cessation of sankhara.

<p><span class="parno">38</span>
Bhikkhus, if a person entrenched in ignorance activates a meritorious
activity, consciousness fares on to the meritorious; if he activates a
demeritorious activity, consciousness fares on to the demeritorious; if he
activates an imperturbable activity, consciousness fares on to the
imperturbable.

<p><span class="parno">39</span>
But from the time, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's ignorance has been abandoned and
noble knowledge has arisen, from the fading away of ignorance, from the
arising of noble knowledge, he neither activates a meritorious activity, nor
activates a demeritorious activity, nor activates an imperturbable
activity. Not activating, not intending, he does not undertake anything in
the world. Not undertaking, he is not perturbed. Not perturbed, he
definately attains parinibbana by himself. He wisely understands:
“Obliterated is birth, lived is the life of purity, done is what had to
be done, there is nothing further [to do] for thusness.”

<p><span class="parno">40</span>
If he is feeling a pleasant feeling, he wisely understands: “It is
impermanent.” He wisely understands: “It is not held
to.” He wisely understands: “It is not delighted in.”
If he is feeling a painful feeling, he wisely understands: “It is
impermanent.” He wisely understands: “It is not held
to.” He wisely understands: “It is not delighted in.”
If he is feeling a neither painful nor pleasant feeling, he wisely
understands: “It is impermanent.” He wisely understands: “It
is not held to.” He wisely understands: “It is not delighted
in.”

<p><span class="parno">41</span>
If he is feeling a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached. If he is feeling
a painful feeling, he feels it detached. If he is feeling a neither painful
nor pleasant feeling, he feels it detached.

<p><span class="parno">42</span>
Feeling a feeling limited to the body, he wisely understands: “I feel a
feeling limited to the body.” Feeling a feeling limited to life, he
wisely understands: “I feel a feeling limited to life.” He
wisely understands: “With the body's breakup, following the exhaustion of
life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right
here. [Mere] bodily remains will be left.”

<p><span class="parno">43</span>
Just as, O bhikkhus, a man, having pulled out a hot clay pot from the
potter's oven, would leave it to stand on the ground. Whatever is heat
there, that would simply dissipate. The clay pot would be left. So too, O
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu feeling a feeling limited to the body, wisely
understands: “I feel a feeling limited to the body.” Feeling a
feeling limited to life, he wisely understands: “I feel a feeling limited
to life.” He wisely understands: “With the body's breakup,
following the exhaustion of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in,
will become cool right here. [Mere] bodily remains will be left.”

<p><span class="parno">44</span>
“So what do you think, O bhikkhus, could a bhikkhu with asavas
obliterated activate a meritorious activity or a demeritorious activity or
an imperturbable activity?”

<p><span class="parno">45</span>
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">46</span>
“But all sankharas not being, from the cessation of sankharas, would
consciousness be discerned?”

<p><span class="parno">47</span>
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">48</span>
“But all consciousness not being, from the cessation of consciousness,
would name-and-form be discerned?”

<p><span class="parno">49</span>
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">50</span>
“But all name-and-form not being, from the cessation of name-and-form,
would the six-sense domain be discerned?”

<p><span class="parno">51</span>
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">52</span>
“But all the six-sense domain not being, from the cessation of the
six-sense domain, would contact be discerned?”

<p><span class="parno">53</span>
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">54</span>
“But all contact not being, from the cessation of contact, would feeling
be discerned?”

<p><span class="parno">55</span>
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">56</span>
“But all feeling not being, from the cessation of feeling, would
thirsting be discerned?”

<p><span class="parno">57</span>
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">58</span>
“But all thirsting not being, from the cessation of thirsting, would
undertaking be discerned?”

<p><span class="parno">59</span>
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">60</span>
“But all undertaking not being, from the cessation of undertaking, would
being be discerned?”

<p><span class="parno">61</span>
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">62</span>
“But all being not being, from the cessation of being, would birth be
discerned?”

<p><span class="parno">63</span>
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">64</span>
“But all birth not being, from the cessation of birth, would old age and
death be discerned?”

<p><span class="parno">65</span>
Certainly not, Bhante.

<p><span class="parno">66</span>
“Good, good, O bhikkhus. It is just so, O bhikkhus, not otherwise. Have
faith in just this, O bhikkhus. Resolve on this. Be without doubt or
perplexity here. Just this, is the end of suffering.”
