<p><span class="parno">1</span>
At one time the Auspicious One dwelled in Kosambi at Ghosita's Park. Then in
the morning time, the Auspicious One, having dressed, having taken bowl and
robes, entered Kosambi for alms food. Having wandered in Kosambi for alms
food, after his meal, having gone back after alms gathering, he set his
dwelling place in order by himself. Having taken bowl and robes, without
having informed his personal attendants, without taking leave of the bhikkhu
Sangha, he set out wondering alone without a companion.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Then not long after the Auspicious One had left, a certain bhikkhu visited
with the venerable Ananda. Upon arrival, he said this to the venerable
Ananda: “Alas! O friend Ananda, the Auspicious One has set his dwelling
place in order by himself. Having taken his bowl and robes, without having
informed his personal attendants, without taking leave of the bhikkhu
Sangha, he has set out wondering alone without a companion”.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“Friend, on whatever occasion the Auspicious One sets his dwelling place
in order by himself, having taken his bowl and robes, without having
informed his personal attendants, without taking leave of the bhikkhu
Sangha, sets out wondering alone without a companion, on that occasion the
Auspicious One wishes to dwell all alone. On that occasion the Auspicious
One is not to be pursued by anyone”.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
So then, the Auspicious One, wandering on tour by stages, by which way [led
to] Parileyyaka, by that way he arrived. There at Parileyyaka, the
Auspicious One just dwelled at the root of an auspicious Sal tree. Later on,
many bhikkhus went to the venerable Ananda. Upon arrival, they exchanged
friendly greetings with the venerable Ananda. Having exchanged friendly
greetings and amiable talk, they sat down to one side. Having sat to one
side, those bhikkhus said this to the venerable Ananda. “O friend Ananda,
a Dhamma talk face to face from the Auspicious One has not been heard by us
for a very long time. O friend Ananda, we wish to hear a Dhamma talk face to
face from the Auspicious One”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
So then, the venerable Ananda stopped by the root of the auspicious Sal tree
in Parileyyaka along with those bhikkhus. Upon arrival, they bowed down to
the Auspicious One and sat down to one side. Having sat to one side, the
Auspicious One instructed, exhorted, inspired, and gladdened those bhikkhus
with a Dhamma talk. At that time, a reflection arose in the mind of a
certain bhikkhu thus: “Precisely, how knowing, how seeing, does the
immediate destruction of asavas come to be?”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
So then the Auspicious One, having known the reflection in the mind of that
bhikkhu with his [own] mind, addressed the bhikkhus: “The Dhamma, O
bhikkhus, has been thoroughly taught by me. The four establishments of
mindfulness have been thoroughly taught. The four right strivings have been
thoroughly taught. The four bases of psychic power have been thoroughly
taught. The five faculties have been thoroughly taught. The five powers have
been thoroughly taught. The seven factors of awakening have been thoroughly
taught. The noble eightfold path has been thoroughly taught. Thus, O
bhikkhus, is the Dhamma ever thoroughly taught by me. And in this Dhamma, O
bhikkhus, ever thoroughly taught by me thus, now a reflection arose in the
mind for an aspiration of a certain bhikkhu thus: “Precisely, how
knowing, how seeing, does the immediate destruction of asavas come to
be?”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
And, O bhikkhus, how knowing, how seeing, does the immediate destruction of
the asavas come to be? “Here, O bhikkhus, the Dhamma-deaf puthujjana, who
does not possess the vision of the noble ones, not an expert, not trained in
the noble ones’ Dhamma, who does not possess the vision of true men, not an
expert, not trained in true men’s Dhamma, recognizes form as from self. Yet,
that which is the very recognition, O bhikkhus, that is a sankhara. But that
sankhara, what is its source? What is its origin? From what is it born? From
what does it come into being?” Touched by a feeling born of
ignorance-contact, O bhikkhus, craving has arisen for the one to whom the
hearing of the Dhamma does not come to be, for the puthujjana. Thence that
sankhara is born.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Thus, O bhikkhus, that very sankhara is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That craving too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That feeling too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That contact too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That ignorance too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. Just so, O bhikkhus, thus knowing, thus seeing, does the
immediate destruction of the asavas come to be.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Indeed not only does he recognize form as from self, but he also recognizes
self as endowed with form. Yet, that which is the very recognition, O
bhikkhus, that is a sankhara. But that sankhara, what is its source? What is
its origin? From what is it born? From what does it come into being? Touched
by a feeling born of ignorance-contact, O bhikkhus, craving has arisen for
the one to whom the hearing of the Dhamma does not come to be, for the
puthujjana. Thence that sankhara is born.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Thus, O bhikkhus, that very sankhara is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That craving too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That feeling too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That contact too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That ignorance too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. Just so, O bhikkhus, thus knowing, thus seeing, does the
immediate destruction of the asavas come to be.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
Indeed not only does he recognize form as from self, nor recognize self as
endowed with form, but he also recognizes form as in self. Yet, that which
is the very recognition, O bhikkhus, that is a sankhara. But that sankhara,
what is its source? What is its origin? From what is it born? From what does
it come into being? Touched by a feeling born of ignorance-contact, O
bhikkhus, craving has arisen for the one to whom the hearing of the Dhamma
does not come to be, for the puthujjana. Thence that sankhara is born.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
Thus, O bhikkhus, that very sankhara is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That craving too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That feeling too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That contact too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That ignorance too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. Just so, O bhikkhus, thus knowing, thus seeing, does the
immediate destruction of the asavas come to be.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
Indeed not only does he recognize form as from self, nor recognize self as
endowed with form, nor recognize form as in self, but he also recognizes
self as in form. Yet, that which is the very recognition, O bhikkhus, that
is a sankhara. But that sankhara, what is its source? What is its origin?
From what is it born? From what does it come into being? Touched by a
feeling born of ignorance-contact, O bhikkhus, craving has arisen for the
one to whom the hearing of the Dhamma does not come to be, for the
puthujjana. Thence that sankhara is born.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
Thus, O bhikkhus, that very sankhara is impermanent, conditioned,

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
Indeed not only does he recognize form as from self, nor recognize self as
endowed with form, nor recognize form as in self, nor recognize self as in
form, but he also recognizes feeling as from self, but he also recognizes
self as endowed with feeling, but he also recognizes feeling as in self, but
he also recognizes self as in feeling, but he also recognizes perception as
self, but he also recognizes self as endowed with perception, but he also
recognizes perception as in self, but he also recognizes self as in
perception, but he also recognizes sankharas as from self, but he also
recognizes self as endowed with sankharas, but he also recognizes sankharas
as in self, but he also recognizes self as in sankharas, but he also
recognizes consciousness as from self, but he also recognizes self as
endowed with consciousness, but he also recognizes consciousness as in self,
but he also recognizes self as in consciousness. Yet, that which is the very

endowed with form, nor recognize form as in self, nor recognize self as in
form, nor recognize feeling as from self, nor recognize self as endowed with
feeling, nor recognize feeling as in self, nor recognize self as in feeling,
nor recognize perception as from self, nor recognize self as endowed with
perception, nor recognize perception as in self, nor recognize self as in
perception, nor recognize sankharas as from self, nor recognize self as
endowed with sankharas nor recognize sankharas as in self, nor recognize
self as in sankharas, nor recognize consciousness as from self, nor
recognize self as endowed with consciousness, nor recognize consciousness as
in self, nor recognize self as in consciousness, but he holds the view thus:
“That which is the self, that is the world. After death, that shall I be,
permanent, everlasting, eternal, not of a nature to change.” Yet,
that which is the eternalist view, O bhikkhus, that is a sankhara. But that
sankhara, what is its source? What is its origin? From what is it born? From
what does it come into being? Touched by a feeling born of
ignorance-contact, O bhikkhus, craving has arisen for the one to whom the
hearing of the Dhamma does not come to be, for the puthujjana. Thence that
sankhara is born.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
Thus, O bhikkhus, that very sankhara is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That craving too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That feeling too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That contact too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. That ignorance too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen. Just so, O bhikkhus, thus knowing, thus seeing, does the
immediate destruction of the asavas come to be.
