Indeed, O bhikkhus, those samanas or brahmanas who do not wisely understand
as it has come to be: “This is suffering;” who do not wisely
understand as it has come to be: “This is the origin of
suffering;” who do not wisely understand as it has come to be:
“This is the cessation of suffering;” who do not wisely
understand as it has come to be: “This is the way leading to the
cessation of suffering;” they look at the face of another samana or
brahmana [thinking]: “Surely, this venerable one, knowing, he knows;
seeing, he sees.” Just as, O bhikkhus, a light cotton wadding or
cotton-wool, grasped by the wind, settles down on an even part of the
ground. An easterly wind would carry it westwards, a westerly wind would
carry it eastwards, a northerly wind would carry it southwards, a southerly
wind would carry it northwards. What is the reason for that? O bhikkhus, [It
is because of] the lightness of the cotton. It is just so, O bhikkhus, those
samanas or brahmanas who do not wisely understand as it has come to be:
“This is suffering;” who do not wisely understand as it has come
to be: “This is the origin of suffering;” who do not wisely
understand as it has come to be: “This is the cessation of
suffering;” who do not wisely understand as it has come to be:
“This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering;” they
look at the face of another samana or brahmana [thinking]: “Surely, this
venerable one, knowing, he knows; seeing, he sees.” What is the
reason for that? O bhikkhus, [it is because of] their blindness to the four
noble truths.

samana or brahmana [thinking]: “Surely, this venerable one, knowing, he
knows; seeing, he sees.” Just as, O bhikkhus, an iron post or a
strong post, deeply planted, well dug in before a city gate is immovable,
unshakable. Even if heavy wind with rain might come from the eastern
direction, that would simply not shake, would not tremble, would not
sway. Even if heavy wind with rain might come from the western direction,
that would simply not shake, would not tremble, would not sway. Even if
heavy wind with rain might come from the northern direction, that would
simply not shake, would not tremble, would not sway. Even if heavy wind with
rain might come from the southern direction, that would simply not shake,
would not tremble, would not sway. What is the reason for that? O bhikkhus,
[it is because] of the depth of its base, the firm foundation of the strong
city gate post. It is just so, O bhikkhus, those samanas or brahmanas who
wisely understand as it has come to be: “This is suffering;” who
wisely understand as it has come to be: “This is the origin of
suffering;” who wisely understand as it has come to be: “This is
the cessation of suffering;” who wisely understand as it has come
to be: “This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering;”
they do not look at the face of another samana or brahmana [thinking]:
“Surely, this venerable one, knowing, he knows; seeing, he
sees.” What is the reason for that? O bhikkhus, [it is because of]
the well-seeing-ness of the four noble truths. Which four? The noble truth
of suffering, the noble truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of
the cessation of suffering, the noble truth of the way leading to the
cessation of suffering.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Therefore, O bhikkhus, an endeavour should be made [to realize]: “This is
suffering;” An endeavour should be made [to realize]: “This is
the origin of suffering;” An endeavour should be made [to realize]:
“This is the cessation of suffering;” An endeavour should be
made [to realize]: “This is the way leading to the cessation of
suffering;”
