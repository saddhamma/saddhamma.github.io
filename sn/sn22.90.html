<p><span class="parno">1</span>
At one time, many elder bhikkhus were dwelling at Baranasi, in the Dear Park
at Isipatana. Then in the evening time, the venerable Channa emerged from
seclusion, [and] having taken key, went from dwelling to dwelling.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Having approached the elder bhikkhus, he said this: “May the venerable
elders advice me. May the venerable elders instruct me. May the venerable
elders give me a Dhamma talk in such a way that I can see the
Dhamma.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
When thus was said, the elder bhikkhus said this to the venerable Channa:
“Form, O friend Channa, is impermanent, feeling is impermanent,
perception is impermanent, sankharas are impermanent, consciousness is
impermanent, form is not self, feeling is not self, perception is not self,
sankharas are not self, consciousness is not self, all sankharas are
impermanent, all dhammas are not self.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
It then occurred to the venerable Channa: “For me too it occurs thus:
“Form is impermanent, feeling is impermanent, perception is impermanent,
sankharas are impermanent, consciousness is impermanent, form is not self,
feeling is not self, perception is not self, sankharas are not self,
consciousness is not self, all sankharas are impermanent, all dhammas are
not self.” And yet my mind does not reach out towards the stilling
of all sankharas, the relinquishment of all appropriations, the destruction
of thirst, fading away, cessation, Nibbana. It does not get pleased in it,
does not get steadied in it, does not gain affinity with it. Rather, longing
and appropriations arise and return again to the mind [with the thought]:
“Then who is my self now?” But such does not happen for one who
sees the Dhamma. Who might teach the Dhamma for me, in such a way that I can
see the Dhamma.”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Then it occurred to the venerable Channa: “Indeed the venerable Ananda
dwells at this Kosambi in Ghosita's park. He is even praised by the Teacher
and esteemed by his wise companions in the life of purity. The venerable
Ananda is able to teach me the dhamma in such a way that I can see the
Dhamma. And for me there is so much love for the venerable Ananda. What if I
were to approach the venerable Ananda?”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Then the venerable Channa, having set his dwelling place in order, having
taken bowl and robes, by which way [led to] the venerable Ananda at
Ghosita's Park in Kosambi, by that way he approached. Having approached the
venerable Ananda, they exchanged friendly greetings. Having exchanged
friendly greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side. Having sat
down to one side, the venerable Channa said this to the venerable Ananda:
“On one occasion, O friend Ananda, I was dwelling at Baranasi, in the
Dear Park at Isipatana. Then in the evening time, I emerged from seclusion,
[and] having taken key, went from dwelling to dwelling. Having approached
the elder bhikkhus, I said this: “May the venerable elders advice me. May
the venerable elders instruct me. May the venerable elders give me a Dhamma
talk in such a way that I can see the Dhamma.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
When thus was said, the elder bhikkhus said this to me: “Form, O friend
Channa, is impermanent, feeling is impermanent, perception is impermanent,
sankharas are impermanent, consciousness is impermanent, form is not self,
feeling is not self, perception is not self, sankharas are not self,
consciousness is not self, all sankharas are impermanent, all dhammas are
not self.”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
It then occurred to me: “For me too it occurs thus: “Form is
impermanent, feeling is impermanent, perception is impermanent, sankharas
are impermanent, consciousness is impermanent, form is not self, feeling is
not self, perception is not self, sankharas are not self, consciousness is
not self, all sankharas are impermanent, all dhammas are not self.”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
And yet my mind does not reach out towards the stilling of all sankharas,
the relinquishment of all appropriations, the destruction of thirst, fading
away, cessation, Nibbana. It does not get pleased in it, does not get
steadied in it, does not gain affinity with it. Rather, longing and
appropriations arise and return again to the mind: “Then who is my self
now?” But such does not happen for one who sees the Dhamma. Who
might teach the Dhamma for me, in such a way that I can see the
Dhamma.”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Then it occurred to me: “Indeed the venerable Ananda dwells at this
Kosambi in Ghosita's park. He is even praised by the Teacher and esteemed by
his wise companions in the life of purity. The venerable Ananda is able to
teach me the dhamma in such a way that I can see the Dhamma. And for me
there is so much love for the venerable Ananda. What if I were to approach
the venerable Ananda?” “May the venerable Ananda advice me. May
the venerable Ananda instruct me. May the venerable Ananda give me a Dhamma
talk in such a way that I can see the Dhamma.”

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
“Even by this much we are pleased with the venerable Channa, satisfied
that the venerable Channa, [having] split asunder his barrenness, has made
it to [our] presence. Lend an ear, O friend Channa, you are capable of
understanding the Dhamma.” Then at that moment, a lofty joy and
rapture arose for the venerable Channa [from the thought]: “I am really
capable of understanding the Dhamma.”

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
In the presence of the Auspicious One, O friend Channa, that was heard by me
and [I] received in his presence, the admonishing for the bhikkhu
Kaccanagotta [thus]: “Indeed, O Kaccana, the majority [view] the world in
dependence on the duality of simply existence and non-existence. But for one
who is seeing the very arising of the world with right wisdom as it has come
to be, O Kaccana, that which is the non-existence in the world, does not
come to be. For one who is seeing the very cessation of the world with right
wisdom as it has come to be, O Kaccana, that which is the existence in the
world, does not come to be. Certainly this world, O Kaccana, is mostly in
the bondage of engagement, holding and adherence. But such one's mind does
not engage, does not hold, does not resolve on engagements and holdings,
resolutions, underlying tendency to adherence, “my self.” He has
no perplexity, no doubt that what arises is only suffering arising, “what
ceases is suffering ceasing.” Indeed his knowledge of this is
independent of others. It is really to that extent, O Kaccana, that there is
right view.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
“All exists.” Indeed, O Kaccana, this is one extreme. “All do
not exist.” This is the second extreme. Not having approached both
these extremes, for you O Kaccana, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by the
middle. “In dependence on ignorance, sankharas come to be. In dependence
on sankharas, consciousness comes to be. In dependence on consciousness,
name and form come to be. In dependence on name and form, the six sense
domains come to be. In dependence on the six sense domains, contact comes to
be. In dependence on contact, feeling comes to be. In dependence on feeling,
thirst comes to be. In dependence on thirst, holding comes to be. In
dependence on holding, being comes to be. In dependence on being, birth
comes to be. In dependence on birth, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation,
physical suffering, mental suffering and despair arise. Just so, is the
arising of this entire amassment of suffering.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
From the complete fading away and cessation of this very ignorance comes
cessation of sankharas. From the cessation of sankharas comes cessation of
consciousness. From the cessation of consciousness comes cessation of name
and form. From the cessation of name and form comes cessation of six sense
domains. From the cessation of six sense domains comes cessation of
contact. From the cessation of contact comes cessation of feeling. From the
cessation of feeling comes cessation of thirst. From the cessation of thirst
comes cessation of holding. From the cessation of holding comes cessation of
being. From the cessation of being comes cessation of birth. From the
cessation of birth, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, physical
suffering, mental suffering and despair cease. Just so, is the cessation of
this entire stock of suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
“Just this comes to be, O friend Ananda, for those venerables who [have]
such compassionate ones, well wishers, advisers, instructors as companions
in the life of purity. And now having heard this Dhamma exposition of the
venerable Ananda, the breakthrough to the Dhamma [has been made] by
me.”
