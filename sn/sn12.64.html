There are these four nutriments, O bhikkhus, for the persistence of beings
who have come to be or for the assistance of those who are seeking to
be. What four? Food eaten in lumps, course of fine. Contact as the
second. Mental intention as the third. Consciousness as the fourth. These, O
bhikkhus, are the four nutriments, for the persistence of beings who have
come to be or for the assistance of those who are seeking to be.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is lust for the nutriment food eaten in lumps, if
there is delight, if there is thirsting, there, consciousness is established
and has come to growth. Where consciousness is established and has come to
growth, there, there is the descent of name-and-form. Where there is the
descent of name-and-form, there, there is growth of sankharas. Where there
is growth of sankharas, there, there is an actualization of a being again in
the future. Where there is an actualization of a being again in the future,
there, there is future old age and death. Where there is future old age and
death, that is accompanied by sorrow, O bhikkhus, dreadful, accompanied by
dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is lust for the nutriment contact, if there is
delight, if there is thirsting, there, consciousness is established and has
come to growth. Where consciousness is established and has come to growth,
there, there is the descent of name-and-form. Where there is the descent of
name-and-form, there, there is growth of sankharas. Where there is growth of
sankharas, there, there is an actualization of a being again in the
future. Where there is an actualization of a being again in the future,
there, there is future old age and death. Where there is future old age and
death, that is accompanied by sorrow, O bhikkhus, dreadful, accompanied by
dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is lust for the nutriment mental intention, if there
is delight, if there is thirsting, there, consciousness is established and
has come to growth. Where consciousness is established and has come to
growth, there, there is the descent of name-and-form. Where there is the
descent of name-and-form, there, there is growth of sankharas. Where there
is growth of sankharas, there, there is an actualization of a being again in
the future. Where there is an actualization of a being again in the future,
there, there is future old age and death. Where there is future old age and
death, that is accompanied by sorrow, O bhikkhus, dreadful, accompanied by
dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is lust for the nutriment consciousness, if there is
delight, if there is thirsting, there, consciousness is established and has
come to growth. Where consciousness is established and has come to growth,
there, there is the descent of name-and-form. Where there is the descent of
name-and-form, there, there is growth of sankharas. Where there is growth of
sankharas, there, there is an actualization of a being again in the
future. Where there is an actualization of a being again in the future,
there, there is future old age and death. Where there is future old age and
death, that is accompanied by sorrow, O bhikkhus, dreadful, accompanied by
dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Suppose, O bhikkhus, there being a red or yellow or blue or crimson dye, an
artist or a painter would create on a well-prepared plank, wall or canvas,
the figure of a man or woman complete in all its features.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
So too, O bhikkhus, if there is lust for the nutriment food eaten in lumps,
if there is delight, if there is thirsting, there, consciousness is
established and has come to growth. Where consciousness is established and
has come to growth, there, there is the descent of name-and-form. Where
there is the descent of name-and-form, there, there is growth of
sankharas. Where there is growth of sankharas, there, there is an
actualization of a being again in the future. Where there is an
actualization of a being again in the future, there, there is future old age
and death. Where there is future old age and death, that is accompanied by
sorrow, O bhikkhus, dreadful, accompanied by dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is lust for the nutriment contact, if there is
delight, if there is thirsting, there, consciousness is established and has
come to growth. Where consciousness is established and has come to growth,
there, there is the descent of name-and-form. Where there is the descent of
name-and-form, there, there is growth of sankharas. Where there is growth of
sankharas, there, there is an actualization of a being again in the
future. Where there is an actualization of a being again in the future,
there, there is future old age and death. Where there is future old age and
death, that is accompanied by sorrow, O bhikkhus, dreadful, accompanied by
dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is lust for the nutriment mental intention, if there
is delight, if there is thirsting, there, consciousness is established and
has come to growth. Where consciousness is established and has come to
growth, there, there is the descent of name-and-form. Where there is the
descent of name-and-form, there, there is growth of sankharas. Where there
is growth of sankharas, there, there is an actualization of a being again in
the future. Where there is an actualization of a being again in the future,
there, there is future old age and death. Where there is future old age and
death, that is accompanied by sorrow, O bhikkhus, dreadful, accompanied by
dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is lust for the nutriment consciousness, if there is
delight, if there is thirsting, there, consciousness is established and has
come to growth. Where consciousness is established and has come to growth,
there, there is the descent of name-and-form. Where there is the descent of
name-and-form, there, there is growth of sankharas. Where there is growth of
sankharas, there, there is an actualization of a being again in the
future. Where there is an actualization of a being again in the future,
there, there is future old age and death. Where there is future old age and
death, that is accompanied by sorrow, O bhikkhus, dreadful, accompanied by
dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is not lust for the nutriment food eaten in lumps, if
there is not delight, if there is not thirsting, there, consciousness is
unestablished and has not come to growth. Where consciousness is
unestablished and has not come to growth, there, there is not the descent of
name-and-form. Where there is not the descent of name-and-form, there, there
is not growth of sankharas. Where there is not growth of sankharas, there,
there is not an actualization of a being again in the future. Where there is
not an actualization of a being again in the future, there, there is no
future old age and death. Where there is no future old age and death, that
is free from sorrow, O bhikkhus, free from dread, free from dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is not lust for the nutriment contact, if there is not
delight, if there is not thirsting, there, consciousness is unestablished
and has not come to growth. Where consciousness is unestablished and has not
come to growth, there, there is not the descent of name-and-form. Where
there is not the descent of name-and-form, there, there is not growth of
sankharas. Where there is not growth of sankharas, there, there is not an
actualization of a being again in the future. Where there is not an
actualization of a being again in the future, there, there is no future old
age and death. Where there is no future old age and death, that is free from
sorrow, O bhikkhus, free from dread, free from dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is not lust for the nutriment mental intention, if
there is not delight, if there is not thirsting, there, consciousness is
unestablished and has not come to growth. Where consciousness is
unestablished and has not come to growth, there, there is not the descent of
name-and-form. Where there is not the descent of name-and-form, there, there
is not growth of sankharas. Where there is not growth of sankharas, there,
there is not an actualization of a being again in the future. Where there is
not an actualization of a being again in the future, there, there is no
future old age and death. Where there is no future old age and death, that
is free from sorrow, O bhikkhus, free from dread, free from dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is not lust for the nutriment consciousness, if there
is not delight, if there is not thirsting, there, consciousness is
unestablished and has not come to growth. Where consciousness is
unestablished and has not come to growth, there, there is not the descent of
name-and-form. Where there is not the descent of name-and-form, there, there
is not growth of sankharas. Where there is not growth of sankharas, there,
there is not an actualization of a being again in the future. Where there is
not an actualization of a being again in the future, there, there is no
future old age and death. Where there is no future old age and death, that
is free from sorrow, O bhikkhus, free from dread, free from dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
Just as, O bhikkhus, a building with a peaked roof or a hall with a peaked
roof would have window to the north or south or west. “If the sun rises
with its ray of light having passed through the window, where will it be
established?” “On the western wall, O Bhante.” “If
there were not a western wall, O bhikkhus, where will it be
established?” “On the earth, O Bhante.” “If there
were no earth, O bhikkhus, where will it be established?” “On
the water, O Bhante.” “If there were no water, O bhikkhus, where
will it be established?” “It will be unestablished, O
Bhante.”

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
So too, O bhikkhus, if there is not lust for the nutriment food eaten in
lumps, if there is not delight, if there is not thirsting, there,
consciousness is unestablished and has not come to growth. Where
consciousness is unestablished and has not come to growth, there, there is
not the descent of name-and-form. Where there is not the descent of
name-and-form, there, there is not growth of sankharas. Where there is not
growth of sankharas, there, there is not an actualization of a being again
in the future. Where there is not an actualization of a being again in the
future, there, there is no future old age and death. Where there is no
future old age and death, that is free from sorrow, O bhikkhus, free from
dread, free from dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is not lust for the nutriment contact, if there is not
delight, if there is not thirsting, there, consciousness is unestablished
and has not come to growth. Where consciousness is unestablished and has not
come to growth, there, there is not the descent of name-and-form. Where
there is not the descent of name-and-form, there, there is not growth of
sankharas. Where there is not growth of sankharas, there, there is not an
actualization of a being again in the future. Where there is not an
actualization of a being again in the future, there, there is no future old
age and death. Where there is no future old age and death, that is free from
sorrow, O bhikkhus, free from dread, free from dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is not lust for the nutriment mental intention, if
there is not delight, if there is not thirsting, there, consciousness is
unestablished and has not come to growth. Where consciousness is
unestablished and has not come to growth, there, there is not the descent of
name-and-form. Where there is not the descent of name-and-form, there, there
is not growth of sankharas. Where there is not growth of sankharas, there,
there is not an actualization of a being again in the future. Where there is
not an actualization of a being again in the future, there, there is no
future old age and death. Where there is no future old age and death, that
is free from sorrow, O bhikkhus, free from dread, free from dispair, I say.

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
If, O bhikkhus, there is not lust for the nutriment consciousness, if there
is not delight, if there is not thirsting, there, consciousness is
unestablished and has not come to growth. Where consciousness is
unestablished and has not come to growth, there, there is not the descent of
name-and-form. Where there is not the descent of name-and-form, there, there
is not growth of sankharas. Where there is not growth of sankharas, there,
there is not an actualization of a being again in the future. Where there is
not an actualization of a being again in the future, there, there is no
future old age and death. Where there is no future old age and death, that
is free from sorrow, O bhikkhus, free from dread, free from dispair, I say.
