It so happened that the Auspicious One, having put a small soil on the tip
of his fingernail, addressed the bhikkhus: “So what do you think, O
bhikkhus, which is more? This small soil put on the tip of a fingernail by
me, or this great earth?”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“This, O Bhante, is clearly more, namely the great earth. This is a
trifle, insignificant, this small soil the Auspicious One has put on the tip
of his fingernail. In comparison with the great earth, this small soil the
Auspicious One has put on the tip of his fingernail does not even count, it
does not even come close to comparison, it does not even approach part of a
fraction.”

It is just so, O bhikkhus, few are those beings who when they pass away as
human beings, take birth among human beings. Rather, simply many are those
beings who when they pass away as human beings, take birth in hell. What is
the reason for that? [Because of] the non-seeing-ness, O bhikkhus, of the
four noble truths. Which four? The noble truth of suffering, the noble truth
of the arising of suffering, the noble truth of the cessation of suffering,
the noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Therefore, O bhikkhus, an endeavour should be made [to realize]: “This is
suffering.” An endeavour should be made [to realize]: “This is
the origination of suffering.” An endeavour should be made [to
realize]: “This is the cessation of suffering.” An endeavour
should be made [to realize]: “This is the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.”
