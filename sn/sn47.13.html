At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove,
Anathapindika's Park. At that time the venerable Sariputta was dwelling
among the Magadhans at Naḷakagama, afflicted, in pain, severely ill. The
novice Cunda was the venerable Sariputta's attendant. Then, the venerable
Sariputta attained nibbana simply due to his afflictions. So then, the
novice Cunda, having taken venerable sāriputta's bowl and robes with him to
anāthapiṇḍika's monastery in Jeta's Grove at Savatthi, by which way [led to]
the venerable Ananda, by that way he approached. Having approached the
venerable Ananda, having bowed down, he sat down to one side. Having sat
down to one side, the novice Cunda said this to the venerable Ananda:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“Bhante, the venerable Sariputta has attained nibbana. This is his bowl
and robes.” “This news, friend, is indeed worth telling the
Auspicious One, having seen him. By which way [leads to] the Auspicious One,
friend Cunda, by that way we must approach. Having approached, we must
inform the Auspicious One of this matter.” “Yes
Bhante.” the novice Cunda assented to venerable Ananda. Then, by
which way [led to] the Auspicious One, by that way the venerable Ananda and
the novice Cunda approached. Having approached the Auspicious One, having
paid respects, they sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side,
indeed the venerable Ananda said this to the Auspicious One: “This novice
Cunda, O Bhante, has said thus. Bhante, the venerable Sariputta has attained
nibbana. This is his bowl and robes.” “Yet having heard: “the
venerable Sariputta has attained nibbana”, O Bhante, my body is as
if weak and stiff. Even the directions are not clearly visible to me. The
teachings too no longer come to my mind.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“O Ananda, did Sariputta attain nibbana having taken your stock of
virtue, or attain nibbana having taken your stock of samadhi, or attain
nibbana having taken your stock of wisdom, or attain nibbana having taken
your stock of liberation, or attained nibbana having taken your stock of
knowledge and vision of liberation?” “Bhante, the venerable did
not attain nibbana having taken my stock of virtue, or attain nibbana having
taken my , stock of samadhi, or attain nibbana having taken my stock of
wisdom, or attain nibbana having taken my stock of liberation, or attain
nibbana having taken my stock of knowledge and vision of liberation. But
Bhante, the venerable Sariputta was an advisor, one who was clever in
instruction, one who instructed, one who aroused, one who energized, one who
gladdened, untiring in his teaching of the Dhamma, a helper of his
companions in the life of purity. We recollect the venerable Sariputta's
nourishment of the Dhamma, wealth of the Dhamma, assistance in the
Dhamma.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Has it not been declared by me already, O Ananda, that only becoming parted,
becoming separated, becoming otherwise, [results] from all which is dear and
pleasing, that of whatever here, O Ananda, is born, has come to be, is
conditioned, liable to disintegration, that “alas! O may it not
disintegrate,” may be obtained, this possibility is not to be
found? Just as, O Ananda, a great tree standing possessed of pith, its
greater branch might crumble, it is really just so, O Ananda, the great
bhikkhu sangha standing possessed of pith, Sariputta has attained
nibbana. That of whatever here, O Ananda, is born, has come to be, is
conditioned, liable to disintegration, that “alas! O may it not
disintegrate,” may be obtained, this possibility is not to be
found. Therefore, O Ananda, dwell with yourselves as your own lamp, with
yourselves as your own refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma
as your lamp, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“And how, O Ananda, does a bhikkhu dwell with himself as his own lamp,
with himself as his own refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma
as his lamp, with the Dhamma as his refuge, with no other refuge: Here O
Ananda, a bhikkhu abides in the body perceiving in accordance with the body,
ardent, mindful and clearly comprehending, having put away worldly
covetousness and longing. He abides in feelings perceiving in accordance
with feelings, ardent, mindful and clearly comprehending, having put away
worldly covetousness and longing. He abides in mind perceiving in accordance
with mind, ardent, mindful and clearly comprehending, having put away
worldly covetousness and longing. He abides in dhammas perceiving in
accordance with dhammas, ardent, mindful and clearly comprehending, having
put away worldly covetousness and longing. It is just so, O Ananda, that a
bhikkhu dwells with himself as your own lamp, with himself as his own
refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma as his lamp, with the
Dhamma as his refuge, with no other refuge. Those who, O Ananda, either at
present or after my passing, dwell with themselves as their own lamps, with
themselves as their own refuges, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma
as their lamp, with the Dhamma as their refuge, with no other refuge, will
be for me, O Ananda, those bhikkhus who are desirous of training to the
highest degree.”
