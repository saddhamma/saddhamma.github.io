At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove,
Anathapindika's Park. At that time the venerable Sariputta was dwelling
among the Magadhans at Nalakagama, afflicted, in pain, severely ill. The
novice Cunda was the venerable Sariputta's attendant. Then, the venerable
Sariputta attained nibbana just due to his afflictions. So then, the novice
Cunda, having taken venerable Sariputta's bowl and robes with him to
Anathapindika's monastery in Jeta's Grove at Savatthi, went to the venerable
Ananda. Upon arrival, he bowed down to the venerable Ananda and sat down to
one side. Having sat down to one side, the novice Cunda said this to the
venerable Ananda:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“Bhante, the venerable Sariputta has attained nibbana. This is his bowl
and robes.” “This news, friend, is indeed worth seeing the
Auspicious One and telling him. We must visit with the Auspicious One,
friend Cunda. Upon arrival, we must inform the Auspicious One of this
matter.” “Yes Bhante.” the novice Cunda assented to
venerable Ananda. Then, the venerable Ananda and the novice Cunda visited
with the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, they bowed down to the Auspicious One
and sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, indeed the venerable
Ananda said this to the Auspicious One: “This novice Cunda, O Bhante, has
said thus. Bhante, the venerable Sariputta has attained nibbana. This is his
bowl and robes.” “Yet having heard: “the venerable Sariputta
has attained nibbana”, O Bhante, my body is as if weak and
stiff. Even the directions are not clearly visible to me. The teachings too
no longer come to my mind.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“O Ananda, did Sariputta attain nibbana having taken your stock of
virtue, or attain nibbana having taken your stock of samadhi, or attain
nibbana having taken your stock of wisdom, or attain nibbana having taken
your stock of liberation, or attained nibbana having taken your stock of
knowledge and vision of liberation?” “Bhante, the venerable did
not attain nibbana having taken my stock of virtue, or attain nibbana having
taken my , stock of samadhi, or attain nibbana having taken my stock of
wisdom, or attain nibbana having taken my stock of liberation, or attain
nibbana having taken my stock of knowledge and vision of liberation. But
Bhante, the venerable Sariputta was an advisor, one who was clever in
instruction, one who instructed, one who aroused, one who energized, one who
gladdened, untiring in his teaching of the Dhamma, a helper of his
companions in the life of purity. We recollect the venerable Sariputta's
nourishment of the Dhamma, wealth of the Dhamma, assistance in the
Dhamma.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Has it not been declared by me already, O Ananda, that only becoming parted,
becoming separated, becoming otherwise, [results] from all which is dear and
pleasing, that of whatever here, O Ananda, is born, has come to be, is
conditioned, liable to disintegration, that “alas! O may it not
disintegrate,” may be obtained, this possibility is not to be
found? Just as, O Ananda, a great tree standing possessed of pith, its
greater branch might crumble, it is really just so, O Ananda, the great
bhikkhu sangha standing possessed of pith, Sariputta has attained
nibbana. That of whatever here, O Ananda, is born, has come to be, is
conditioned, liable to disintegration, that “alas! O may it not
disintegrate,” may be obtained, this possibility is not to be
found. Therefore, O Ananda, dwell with yourselves as your own lamp, with
yourselves as your own refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma
as your lamp, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“And how, O Ananda, does a bhikkhu dwell with himself as his own lamp,
with himself as his own refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma
as his lamp, with the Dhamma as his refuge, with no other refuge: Here O
Ananda, having put away worldly covetousness and longing, a bhikkhu abides
in the body perceiving in accordance with the body as an ardent, clearly
comprehending and mindful one. Having put away worldly covetousness and
longing, he abides in feelings perceiving in accordance with feelings as an
ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful one. Having put away worldly
covetousness and longing, he abides in mind perceiving in accordance with
mind as an ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful one. Having put away
worldly covetousness and longing, he abides in dhammas perceiving in
accordance with dhammas as an ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful
one. It is just so, O Ananda, that a bhikkhu dwells with himself as his own
lamp, with himself as his own refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the
Dhamma as his lamp, with the Dhamma as his refuge, with no other
refuge. Those who, O Ananda, either at present or after my passing, dwell
with themselves as their own lamps, with themselves as their own refuges,
with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma as their lamp, with the Dhamma
as their refuge, with no other refuge, will be for me, O Ananda, those
bhikkhus who are desirous of training to the highest degree.”
