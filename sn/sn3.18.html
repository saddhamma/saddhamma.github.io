At Savatthi

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Having sat down at one side, king Pasenadi of Kosala said this to the
Auspicious One: Here, O Bhante, for me gone to a lonely place for seclusion,
a reflection of the mind arose thus: “The dhamma is well-proclaimed by
the Auspicious One, but [for] one of noble friend, of noble companion, of
noble comrad, not of evil friend, not of evil companion, not of evil
comrad.”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
That is so, O great king, that is so, O great king, “The dhamma is
well-proclaimed by me, but [for] one of noble friend, of noble companion, of
noble comrad, not of evil friend, not of evil companion, not of evil
comrad.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
On this one occasion, O great king, I was living among the Sakkians, at a
Sakyan market town named Nagaraka. Then, O great king, the bhikkhu Ananda
visited with me. Upon arrival, he bowed down to me and sat down to one
side. Having sat down to one side, O great king, the bhikkhu Ananda said
this to me: “This, O Bhante, is half of the life of purity, that is,
noble friendship, noble companionship, noble comradship.” When thus
was said, O great king, I said this to the bhikkhu Ananda: “Indeed not
so, O Ananda, indeed not so, O Ananda. Indeed, O Ananda, this is solely the
whole of the life of purity, that is, noble friendship, noble companionship,
noble comradship.” This, O Ananda, is to be expected of a bhikkhu
of noble friend, of noble companion, of noble comrad, that he will nurture
the noble eight-fold path into maturation, that he will make abundant the
noble eight-fold path.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
And how, O Ananda, does a bhikkhu of noble friend, of noble companion, of
noble comrad, nurtures into maturation the noble eight-fold path, makes
abundant the noble eight-fold path ? Here, O Ananda, a bhikkku nurtures into
maturation right view, in dependence on seclusion, in dependence on fading
away, in dependence on cessation, maturing in relinquishment. He  nurtures
into maturation right thought, in dependence on seclusion, in dependence on
fading away, in dependence on cessation, maturing in relinquishment. He
nurtures into maturation right speech, in dependence on seclusion, in
dependence on fading away, in dependence on cessation, maturing in
relinquishment. He nurtures into maturation right action, in dependence on
seclusion, in dependence on fading away, in dependence on cessation,
maturing in relinquishment. He nurtures into maturation right livelihood, in
dependence on seclusion, in dependence on fading away, in dependence on
cessation, maturing in relinquishment. He nurtures into maturation right
effort, in dependence on seclusion, in dependence on fading away, in
dependence on cessation, maturing in relinquishment. He nurtures into
maturation right mindfulness, in dependence on seclusion, in dependence on
fading away, in dependence on cessation, maturing in relinquishment. He
nurtures into maturation right samadhi, in dependence on seclusion, in
dependence on fading away, in dependence on cessation, maturing in
relinquishment. It is thus, O Ananda, that a bhikkhu of noble friend, of
noble companion, of noble comrad, nurtures into maturation the noble
eight-fold path, makes abundant the noble eight-fold path.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“By this method, O Ananda, it could be understood: how this is solely the
whole of the life of purity, that is, noble friendship, noble companionship,
noble comradship.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
“Because of me, O Ananda, owing to [me as] a noble friend, beings liable
to birth are freed from birth. Beings liable to old age are freed from old
age. Beings liable to sickness are freed from sickness. Beings liable to
death are freed from death. Beings liable to sorrow, lamentation, physical
suffering, mental suffering and despair are freed from sorrow, lamentation,
physical suffering, mental suffering and despair. By this method, O Ananda,
it could be understood: how this is solely the whole of the life of purity,
that is, noble friendship, noble companionship, noble comradship.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Therefore, for you, O great king, it should be trained thus: “I will be
of noble friend, noble companion, noble comrad.” Thus indeed for
you, O great king, should it be trained. For you, O great king, [being] of
noble friends, of noble companion, of noble comrad, you should dwell
depending on this dhamma alone, as one who is vigilant in wholesome dhammas.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Of you, O great king, dwelling vigilantly, depending on vigilance, it will
occur to your harem-ladies thus: “The king dwells vigilantly, depending
on vigilance. Well, we too must dwell vigilantly, depending on
vigilance.”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Of you, O great king, dwelling vigilantly, depending on vigilance, it will
occur to your khattiya vassals too thus: “The king dwells vigilantly,
depending on vigilance. Well, we too must dwell vigilantly, depending on
vigilance.”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Of you, O great king, dwelling vigilantly, depending on vigilance, it will
occur to your army too thus: “The king dwells vigilantly, depending on
vigilance. Well, we too must dwell vigilantly, depending on
vigilance.”

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
Of you, O great king, dwelling vigilantly, depending on vigilance, it will
occur to your town and country people too thus: “The king dwells
vigilantly, depending on vigilance. Well, we too must dwell vigilantly,
depending on vigilance.”

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
“Of you, O great king, dwelling vigilantly, depending on vigilance, you
yourself will be protected and guarded, the harem-ladies too will be
protected and guarded, the treasury and store house too will be protected
and guarded.”

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “The wise ones commend vigilance in meritorious deeds,<br>  by those
desiring lofty riches in succession;
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   The vigilant, wise one possesses both benefits,<br> benefit in the present
life and benefit belonging to the next world.<br> From the breakthrough to the
meaning, the resolute one is called wise.”
