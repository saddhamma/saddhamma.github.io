At one time, the Auspicious One was dwelling at Vesali in the Great Wood, at
the Hall with the Peaked Roof. Then, Nandaka, the Licchavi minister, visited
with the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, he bowed down to the Auspicious One
and sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the Auspicious One
said this to Nandaka, the Licchavi minister: Endowed with four dhammas, O
Nandaka, a noble disciple is a sotapanna, not subject to the woeful plane,
on a fixed course, destined for supreme awakening. Which four? Here, O
Nandaka, a noble disciple is endowed with confirmed faith in the Buddha:
“Truly is he the Auspicious One, the Arahant, rightly self-awakened,
excelling in knowledge and conduct, well-farer, knower of worlds,
incomparable charioteer of tamed persons, teacher of devas and humans,
awakened, auspicious.” He is endowed with confirmed faith in the
Dhamma: “The Dhamma is well-proclaimed by the Auspicious One, visible in
this life, not involving time, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be
comprehended by the wise, each one for one's self.” He is endowed
with confirmed faith in the Sangha: “The Sangha of the Auspicious One’s
disciples have entered upon the good path, the Sangha of the Auspicious
One’s disciples have entered upon the straight path, the Sangha of the
Auspicious One’s disciples have entered upon the true path, the Sangha of
the Auspicious One’s disciples have entered upon the proper path; that is,
the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals. This Sangha of
the Auspicious One’s disciples are worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality,
worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field
of merit for the world.” He is endowed with the virtues dear to the
noble ones: “Unbroken, untorn, unmottled, unspeckled, freeing, praised by
the wise, unadhered to, leading to samadhi.” Endowed with these
four dhammas, O Nandaka, a noble disciple is a sotapanna, not subject to the
woeful plane, on a fixed course, destined for supreme awakening.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“Moreover, O Nandaka, a noble disciple endowed with these four dhammas is
bound to long life, both celestial and human, is bound to beauty, both
celestial and human, is bound to happiness, both celestial and human, is
bound to power, both celestial and human. But I, O Nandaka, say this not
having heard it of another samana or brahmana. Rather, I only say just what
I have understood by myself, seen by myself, known by myself.” When
thus was said, a certain man said this to Nandaka, the Licchavi minister:
“Venerable sir, now is the time for your bath.” “Now enough
of you, with this external bath. This internal bath will be enough, that is,
faith in the Auspicious One.”
