O bhikkhus, those bhikkhus excelling in virtue, excelling in samadhi,
excelling in wisdom, excelling in liberation, excelling in knowledge and
vision of liberation, the possibility of seeing them, O bhikkhus, is very
helpful for a bhikkhu, I say. The possibility of hearing them, O bhikkhus,
is very helpful for a bhikkhu, I say. The possibility of approaching them, O
bhikkhus, is very helpful for a bhikkhu, I say. The possibility of attending
on them, O bhikkhus, is very helpful for a bhikkhu, I say. The possibility
of recollecting them, O bhikkhus, is very helpful for a bhikkhu, I say. The
possibility of following their example by going forth, O bhikkhus, is very
helpful for a bhikkhu, I say. What is the reason for that? Having heard the
Dhamma of such a form of bhikkhu, O bhikkhus, one abides by a two-fold
withdrawal, by bodily seclusion and by mental seclusion. Dwelling thus
withdrawn, one recollects that Dhamma and ponders it over.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
On the occasion, O bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu dwelling thus withdrawn,
recollects that Dhamma and ponders it over, on that occasion the awakening
factor of mindfulness is aroused for that bhikkhu. On that occasion the
bhikkhu brings into being the awakening factor of mindfulness. On that
occasion the awakening factor of mindfulness goes to full maturation for
that bhikkhu. Dwelling thus mindfully, he examines, thoroughly investigates,
undertakes a thorough examination of that Dhamma with wisdom.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
On the occasion, O bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu dwelling thus mindfully,
examines, thoroughly investigates, undertakes a thorough examination of that
Dhamma with wisdom, on that occasion the awakening factor of investigation
of Dhammas is aroused for that bhikkhu. On that occasion the bhikkhu brings
into being the awakening factor of investigation of Dhammas. On that
occasion the awakening factor of investigation of Dhammas goes to full
maturation for that bhikkhu. For him examining, thoroughly investigating,
undergoing thorough examination of that Dhamma with wisdom, energy comes to
be aroused, not sluggish.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
On the occasion, O bhikkhus, when for a bhikkhu examining, thoroughly
investigating, undergoing thorough examination of that dhamma with wisdom,
energy is aroused, not sluggish, on that occasion the awakening factor of
energy is aroused for that bhikkhu. On that occasion the bhikkhu brings into
being the awakening factor of energy. On that occasion the awakening factor
of energy goes to full maturation for that bhikkhu. For one with energy
aroused, non-sensual rapture arises.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
On the occasion, O bhikkhus, when for a bhikkhu with energy aroused,
non-sensual rapture arises, on that occasion the awakening factor of rapture
is aroused for that bhikkhu. On that occasion the bhikkhu brings into being
the awakening factor of rapture. On that occasion the awakening factor of
rapture goes to full maturation for that bhikkhu. For one of rapturous mind,
the body becomes tranquil, the mind also becomes tranquil.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
On the occasion, O bhikkhus, when for a bhikkhu of rapturous mind, the body
becomes tranquil, the mind also becomes tranquil, on that occasion the
awakening factor of tranquility is aroused for that bhikkhu. On that
occasion the bhikkhu brings into being the awakening factor of
tranquility. On that occasion the awakening factor of tranquility goes to
full maturation for that bhikkhu. For one whose body is tranquil, there is
pleasure. The mind of one in pleasure attains samadhi.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
On the occasion, O bhikkhus, when for a bhikkhu whose body is tranquil, the
mind of [such a] one in pleasure attains samadhi, on that occasion the
awakening factor of samadhi is aroused for that bhikkhu. On that occasion
the bhikkhu brings into being the awakening factor of samadhi. On that
occasion the awakening factor of samadhi goes to full maturation for that
bhikkhu. His mind thus in samadhi, he is one who thoroughly looks on with
equanimity.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
On the occasion, O bhikkhus, when for a bhikkhu whose mind thus in samadhi,
is one who thoroughly looks on with equanimity, on that occasion the
awakening factor of equanimity is aroused for that bhikkhu. On that occasion
the bhikkhu brings into being the awakening factor of equanimity. On that
occasion the awakening factor of equanimity goes to full maturation for that
bhikkhu.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
“O bhikkhus, seven fruits, seven good results are to be expected in the
seven factors of awakening thus matured, thus made abundant. Which seven
fruits, seven good results? One accomplishes final knowledge in just this
very life beforehand. If one does not accomplish final knowledge in just
this very life beforehand, then one accomplishes final knowledge at the time
of death. If one does not accomplish final knowledge in just this very life
beforehand, if one does not accomplish final knowledge at the time of death,
then from the complete destruction of the five fetters that binds one to the
near shore, one comes to be an attainer of nibbana between [death and
arising]. If one does not accomplish final knowledge in just this very life
beforehand, if one does not accomplish final knowledge at the time of death,
if from the complete destruction of the five fetters that binds one to the
near shore, one does not come to be an attainer of nibbana between [death
and arising], then from the complete destruction of the five fetters that
binds one to the near shore, one comes to be an attainer of nibbana upon
arrival. If one does not accomplish final knowledge in just this very life
beforehand, if one does not accomplish final knowledge at the time of death,
if from the complete destruction of the five fetters that binds one to the
near shore, one does not come to be an attainer of nibbana between [death
and arising], if from the complete destruction of the five fetters that
binds one to the near shore, one does not come to be an attainer of nibbana
upon arrival, then from the complete destruction of the five fetters that
binds one to the near shore, one comes to be an attainer of nibbana without
effort.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
If one does not accomplish final knowledge in just this very life
beforehand, if one does not accomplish final knowledge at the time of death,
if from the complete destruction of the five fetters that binds one to the
near shore, one does not come to be an attainer of nibbana between [death
and arising], if from the complete destruction of the five fetters that
binds one to the near shore, one does not come to be an attainer of nibbana
upon arrival, if from the complete destruction of the five fetters that

without effort, then from the complete destruction of the five fetters that

effort.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>

with effort, then from the complete destruction of the five fetters that
binds one to the near shore, one comes to be bound upstream, one who goes to
the Akanittha realm. O bhikkhus, these seven fruits, seven good results are
to be expected in the seven factors of awakening thus matured, thus made
abundant.”
