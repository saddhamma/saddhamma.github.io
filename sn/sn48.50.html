At one time the Auspicious One lived among the Angans, in a market town
named Apana. At that place the Auspicious One addressed the venerable
Sariputta: “Sariputta, would the noble disciple who is completely
well-settled in the Tathagata, the one of higher confidence, have perplexity
or doubt in the Tathagata or the Tathagata's instructions?”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Bhante, the noble disciple who is completely well-settled in the Tathagata,
the one of higher confidence, would not have perplexity or doubt in the
Tathagata or the Tathagata's instructions. Certainly Bhante, this is to be
expected of a noble disciple of faith: that he will abide firm in energy for
the abandoning of unwholesome dhammas, for the attainment of wholesome
dhammas. He will be strong, energetic, not laying aside the responsibilities
in [striving for] wholesome dhammas. Indeed, that energy of his, O Bhante,
is his faculty of energy. Certainly Bhante, this is to be expected of a
noble disciple of faith, of firm energy: that he will be a mindful one,
endowed with supreme mindfulness and prudence. A rememberer, one who
remembers what was done long [ago] and what was said long [ago]. Indeed,
that mindfulness of his, O Bhante, is his faculty of mindfulness. Certainly
Bhante, this is to be expected of a noble disciple of faith, of firm energy,
of established mindfulness: that having gained a foothold in relinquishment,
he will attain samadhi, will attain the unique peak of mind. Indeed, that
samadhi of his, O Bhante, is his faculty of samadhi.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Certainly Bhante, this is to be expected of a noble disciple of faith, of
firm energy, of established mindfulness, of a mind attained to samadhi: that
he will know thus: “This samsara is without a discoverable beginning. A
first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on, hindered by
ignorance and fettered by thirst. The remainderless fading away and
cessation of just this ignorance, the mass of darkness, this is the peaceful
path, this is the most excellent path, that is, the stilling of all
sankharas, the relinquishment of all appropriations, the destruction of
thirst, fading away, cessation, nibbana.” Indeed, that wisdom of
his, O Bhante, is his faculty of wisdom. Bhante, of him having striven again
and again thus, having established mindfulness again and again thus, having
attained samadhi again and again thus, having wisely understood again and
again thus, that noble disciple gains the higher faith thus: “These are
those dhammas which formerly was only heard of by me. Now, at present, I
dwell having touched them with the body and I see having penetrated them
with wisdom.” Indeed, that faith of his, O Bhante, is his faculty
of faith.
