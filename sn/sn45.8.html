At Savatthi:

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
“The noble eightfold path, O bhikkhus, I will expound and I will analyze
for you. Listen to that and do mind it well, I will speak.” “Yes
Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied to the Auspicious One. The
Auspicious One said this: “And what, O bhikkhus, is the noble eightfold
path? That is, right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right samadhi.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, is right view? O bhikkhus, it is the knowledgeability
in suffering, the knowledgeability in the arising of suffering, the
knowledgeability in the cessation of suffering, the knowledgeability in the
path leading to the cessation of suffering. This, O bhikkhus, is called
right view.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, is right thought? It is, O bhikkhus, thought of
renunciation, thought of non-ill-will, thought of non-harming. This, O
bhikkhus, is called right thought.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, is right speech? It is, O bhikkhus, abstinence from
false speech, abstinence from divisive speech, abstinence from harsh speech,
abstinence from senseless prattle. This, O bhikkhus, is called right speech.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, is right action? It is, O bhikkhus, abstinence from
killing living beings, abstinence from taking what is not given, abstinence
from non-celibacy. This, O bhikkhus, is called right action.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, is right livelihood? Here, O bhikkhus, a noble
disciple, having abandoned wrong means of livelihood, makes his living by
right livelihood. This, O bhikkhus, is called right livelihood.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, is right effort? Here, O bhikkhus, for the non-arising
of unarisen evil, unwholesome dhammas, a bhikkhu causes desire to be born,
endeavors, initiates effort, asserts the mind and strives. For the
abandoning of arisen evil, unwholesome dhammas, he causes desire to be born,
endeavors, initiates effort, asserts the mind and strives. For the arising
of unarisen wholesome dhammas, he causes desire to be born, endeavors,
initiates effort, asserts the mind and strives. For the persistence, non
confusion, increasing, full development, maturation and completion of arisen
wholesome dhammas, he causes desire to be born, endeavors, initiates effort,
asserts the mind and strives. This, O bhikkhus, is called right effort.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, is right mindfulness? Here, O bhikkhus, having put
away worldly covetousness and longing, a bhikkhu abides in the body
perceiving in accordance with the body as an ardent, clearly comprehending
and mindful one. Having put away worldly covetousness and longing, he abides
in feelings perceiving in accordance with feelings as an ardent, clearly
comprehending and mindful one. Having put away worldly covetousness and
longing, he abides in states of mind perceiving in accordance with states of
mind as an ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful one. Having put away
worldly covetousness and longing, he abides in dhammas perceiving in
accordance with dhammas as an ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful
one. This, O bhikkhus, is called right mindfulness.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
And what, O bhikkhus, is right samadhi? Here, O bhikkhus, quite secluded
from sense-desires, secluded from unwholesome dhammas, a bhikkhu enters upon
and abides in the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, connected with
thinking and pondering, the first jhana. From the subsiding of thinking and
pondering, with the internal tranquilization and unification of mind [due
to] the absence of thinking and pondering, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides
in the rapture and pleasure born of samadhi, the second jhana. With
detachment from rapture, a bhikkhu dwelling mindful and clearly
comprehending, looks on with equanimity as he experiences pleasure in the
body, of which the Noble Ones say: “He is a mindful one who [looks on
with] equanimity, one who dwells in pleasure,” he enters upon and
abides in the third jhana. From the abandoning of [physical] pleasure and
pain, from the disappearance of former mental pleasure and mental pain, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the utter purity of mindfulness and
equanimity without pain and pleasure, the fourth jhana. This, O bhikkhus, is
called right samadhi.”
