Eventhough, O bhikkhus, Uddaka Ramaputta, [used to] utter such sayings:

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Certainly, this is a knowledge master,<br> certainly, this is a universal
conqueror;<br> certainly, this [previously] unexpunged<br> tumor's root is
expunged.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Yet, O bhikkhus, this Uddaka Ramaputta, he clearly not being a knowledge
master, [used to] declare: “I am a knowledge master.” Clearly
not being a universal conqueror, [used to] declare: “I am a universal
conqueror.” [With] the tumor's root clearly unexpunged, [used to]
declare: “Indeed, the tumor's root is expunged.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“In fact it is here, O bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu rightly saying might
say:”

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Certainly, this is a knowledge master,<br> certainly, this is a universal
conqueror;<br> certainly, this [previously] unexpunged<br> tumor's root is
expunged.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
And how, O bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu a knowledge master? From when, O bhikkhus,
a bhikkhu wisely understands the arising, the extinction, the gratification,
the liability and the stepping out of the six domains for contact as they
have come to be, O bhikkhus, such a bhikkhu becomes a knowledge master.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
And how, O bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu a universal conqueror? From when, O
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu having known as they have come to be the arising, the
extinction, the gratification, the liability and the stepping out of the six
domains for contact, not having appropriated, he is liberated, such a
bhikkhu becomes a universal conqueror.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
And how, O bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu's [previously] unexpunged tumor's root
comes to be expunged? “Tumor,” O bhikkhus, this is a designation
for this body [composed] of the four great elements, originating from father
and mother, built up out of rice and porridge, impermanent, liable to
pressure and crushing, to breaking up and destruction. “Tumor's
root,” O bhikkhus, this is a designation for thirst. From when, O
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu's thirsts are abandoned, cut off at the root, made like
palm stumps, obliterated so that they are not liable to future arising. O
bhikkhus, such a bhikkhu's [previously] unexpunged tumor's root comes to be
expunged.
