At one time the Auspicious One resided at the Sakkian [town of] kapilavatthu
in Nigrodha's park. At that time Sarakani the Sakkian had passed away. The
Auspicious One declared him “a sotapanna, not subject to the woeful
plane, on a fixed course, destined for supreme awakening.” There,
so many Sakkians, having assembled, having met together, protesting, being
dejected, speaking in dispraise [said]: “It is marvellous indeed, Sir, it
is unprecedented indeed, Sir. Now who here will not be a sotapanna, in as
much as the Auspicious One has declared Sarakani, the Sakkian [who] passed
away, [to be] a sotapanna, not subject to the woeful plane, on a fixed
course, destined for supreme awakening.” “Sarakani, the Sakkian
endured weakness in the discipline, a drinker, one [fond] of drinking strong
drinks.”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
So then, by which way the Auspicious One [had gone], by that way Mahanama
the Sakkian, approached. Having approached the Auspicious One, having bowed
down, he sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, Mahanama the
Sakkian, ever said this to the Auspicious One: “Here  Bhante, Sarakani
the Sakkian has passed away. The Auspicious One has declared him “a
sotapanna, not subject to the woeful plane, on a fixed course, destined for
supreme awakening.” There, so many Sakkians, having assembled,
having met together, protesting, being dejected, speaking in dispraise
[said]: “It is marvellous indeed, Sir, it is unprecedented indeed,
Sir. Now who here will not be a sotapanna, in as much as the Auspicious One
has declared Sarakani, the Sakkian [who] passed away, [to be] a sotapanna,
not subject to the woeful plane, on a fixed course, destined for supreme
awakening.” “Sarakani, the Sakkian endured weakness in the
discipline, a drinker, one [fond] of drinking strong drinks.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Mahanama, he [was] the male lay disciple who for a long time had gone to the
Buddha as refuge, gone to the Dhamma as refuge, gone to the Sangha as
refuge, [so] how could he go to the woeful plane? Indeed Mahanama, that
which [one] correctly saying would say, “for a long time a male lay
disciple has gone to the Buddha as refuge, gone to the Dhamma as refuge,
gone to the Sangha as refuge,” [it would be of] Sarakani the
Sakkian [that one] correctly saying would say this. Mahanama, Sarakani the
Sakkian [was] the male lay disciple who for a long time had gone to the
Buddha as refuge, gone to the Dhamma as refuge, gone to the Sangha as
refuge, so how could he go to the woeful plane?

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Here Mahanama, a certain individual is endowed with confirmed faith in the
Buddha [thus]: “Truly is he the Auspicious One, the Arahant, rightly
self-awakened, excelling in knowledge and conduct, well-farer, knower of
worlds, incomparable trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and
humans, awakened, auspicious.” He is endowed with confirmed faith
in the Dhamma [thus]: “The Dhamma is well-proclaimed by the Auspicious
One, visible in this life, not involving time, inviting inspection, leading
onwards, to be comprehended by the wise, each one for one's self.”
He is endowed with confirmed faith in the Sangha [thus]: “The Sangha of
the Auspicious One’s disciples has entered upon the good path, the Sangha of
the Auspicious One’s disciples has entered upon the straight path, the
Sangha of the Auspicious One’s disciples has entered upon the true path, the
Sangha of the Auspicious One’s disciples has entered upon the proper path;
that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals. This
Sangha of the Auspicious One’s disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of
hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the
unsurpassed field of merit for the world.” He is one of jubilant
wisdom, one of swift wisdom, and one who excels in liberation. With the
destruction of the asavas, having realized for himself with direct
knowledge, in this very life, the asava-free liberation by state of mind,
liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it. This
individual, Mahanama, is ever free from hell, free from the animal womb,
free from the sphere of ghost, free from lower worlds, unhappy destination,
the woeful plane.

wisdom, one of swift wisdom, but not one who excels in liberation. From the
complete destruction of the five fetters that binds one to the near shore,
he comes to be born spontaneously [in the pure abodes]. He is one bound to
attained final nibbana in that place, not subject to return from that
world. This individual too, Mahanama, is ever free from hell, free from the
animal womb, free from the sphere of ghost, free from lower worlds, unhappy
destination, the woeful plane.

jubilant wisdom, not one of swift wisdom, and not one who excels in
liberation. From the complete destruction of the three fetters and reduction
of greed, hatred and delusion, he is a sakadagami, who having come back only
once to this world, makes the stilling of suffering. This individual too,
Mahanama, is ever free from hell, free from the animal womb, free from the
sphere of ghost, free from lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful
plane.

Here Mahanama, a certain individual is not quite endowed with confirmed
faith in the Buddha [thus]: “Truly is he the Auspicious One, the Arahant,
rightly self-awakened, excelling in knowledge and conduct, well-farer,
knower of worlds, incomparable trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of
devas and humans, awakened, auspicious.” He is endowed with

types of individuals. This Sangha of the Auspicious One’s disciples is
worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of
reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the
world.” He is not one of jubilant wisdom, not one of swift wisdom,
and not one who is endowed with liberation. But he has a measure of
understanding and approves of the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata for
[the sake of] wisdom. And for him, these dhammas too come to be. That is:
the faith faculty, the energy faculty, the mindfulness faculty, the samadhi
faculty, the wisdom faculty. This individual too, Mahanama, is ever free
from hell, free from the animal womb, free from the sphere of ghost, free
from lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane.

“Mahanama, even if these great sal trees could understand [what is]
well-spoken and [what is] badly-spoken, [then] I would declare in these
great sal trees [to be] “sotapanna, not subject to the woeful plane, on a
fixed course, destined for supreme awakening.” But how much more
Sarakani the Sakkian. Nevertheless, Mahanama, Sarakani the Sakkian upheld
the discipline at the time of death”
