It so happened that the Auspicious One, having put a small soil on the tip
of his fingernail, addressed the bhikkhus: “So what do you think, O
bhikkhus, which is more? This small soil put on the tip of a fingernail by
me, or this great earth?”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“This, O Bhante, is clearly more, namely the great earth. This is a
trifle, insignificant, this small soil the Auspicious One has put on the tip
of his fingernail. In comparison with the great earth, this small soil the
Auspicious One has put on the tip of his fingernail does not even count, it
does not even come close to comparison, it does not even approach part of a
fraction.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
It is just so, O bhikkhus, for the noble disciple. For the one accomplished
in view, for the individual who has made the breakthrough, just this is
more, namely, the suffering that is completely destroyed, exhausted, [while
the suffering] left over is insignificant. In comparison with the former
stock of suffering that is completely destroyed, exhausted, this does not
even count, it does not even come close to comparison, it does not even
approach part of a fraction, namely, the seven lives at most [remaining] for
the one who understands as it has come to be: “This is
suffering”; understands as it has come to be: “This is the
origination of suffering”; understands as it has come to be:
“This is the cessation of suffering”; understands as it has come
to be: “This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Therefore, O bhikkhus, an endeavour should be made [to realize]: “This is
suffering.” An endeavour should be made [to realize]: “This is
the origination of suffering.” An endeavour should be made [to
realize]: “This is the cessation of suffering.” An endeavour
should be made [to realize]: “This is the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.”
