In Savatthi:

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
“Form, O bhikkhus, is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. Feeling
is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. Perception is impermanent,
changing, becoming otherwise. Sankharas are impermanent, changing, becoming
otherwise. Consciousness is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
He who, O bhikkhus, has faith in and gains affinity to these dhammas thus,
this is called a saddhanusari [faith follower], one who has entered upon the
fixed course of rightness, who has entered the plane of the true man, who
has transcended the plane of the puthujjana. He is unable to do that deed
which having done such a deed, he would arise in hell, or the animal womb or
the sphere of ghost. He is definately incapable of passing away as long as
he has not realized the fruit of sotapatti [stream entry].

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
For he who, O bhikkhus, approves of these dhammas thus, [if] there is a
measure of understanding with wisdom, this is called a dhammanusari [dhamma
follower], one who has entered upon the fixed course of rightness, who has
entered the plane of the true man, who has transcended the plane of the
puthujjana. He is unable to do that deed which having done such a deed, he
would arise in hell, or the animal womb, or the sphere of ghost. He is
definately incapable of passing away as long as he has not realized the
fruit of sotapatti [stream entry].

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
He who, O bhikkhus, knows thus, sees thus, into these dhammas, this is
called a sotapanna [stream enterer], not subject to the woeful plane, on a
fixed course, destined for supreme awakening.”
