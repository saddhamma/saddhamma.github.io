At one time Anathapindika, the head of household, was afflicted, in pain,
severely ill. Then Anathapindika, the head of household, addressed a certain
man: “Come you good man, by which [way leads to] the venerable Sariputta,
by that [way] approach. Having approached, pay homage in my name [with your]
head at the venerable Sariputta's feet [and say:], Anathapindika, O Bhante,
the head of household, is afflicted, in pain, severely ill, he pays homage
[with his] head at the venerable Sariputta's feet.” Then speak
thus: “[It would be] really good, O Bhante, [if] the venerable Sariputta
[would] approach the house of Anathapindika, the head of household, out of
compassion.”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Yes sir, the man having replied Anathapindika, the head of household, by
which [way led to] the venerable Sariputta, by that [way] he
approached. Having approached the venerable Sariputta, having bowed down, he
sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the man said this to the
venerable Sariputta: “Anathapindika, O Bhante, the head of household, is
afflicted, in pain, severely ill, he pays homage [with his] head at the
venerable Sariputta's feet.” And he says thus: “[It would be]
really good, O Bhante, [if] the venerable Sariputta [would] approach the
house of Anathapindika, the head of household, out of compassion.”
The venerable Sariputta consented by silence.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
So then, in the morning, the venerable Sariputta, having dressed, having
taken bowl and robe, with the venerable Ananda as his companion, by which
[way led to] the house of Anathapindika, the head of household, by that way
they approached. Having approached, he sat down on a prepared seat. Having
sat down, the venerable Sariputta ever said this to Anathapindika, the head
of household: “I hope, O head of household, that you are bearing up. I
hope you are keeping on. I hope your painful feelings are diminishing not
increasing, and that their diminishing is evident, not their
increasing.” “For me, O Bhante, there is no bearing up, no
keeping on. For me severe painful feelings are increasing, not diminishing,
and their increasing is evident, not their diminishing.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
But in fact, O head of household, the form of faithlessness in the Buddha
that the one to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a
puthujjana, is endowed with [because of which] with the breakup of the body,
after death, he reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the
woeful plane, hell, for you there is not that form of faithlessness in the
Buddha. But for you, O head of household, there is confirmed faith in the
Buddha [thus]: “Truly is he the Auspicious One, the Arahant, rightly
self-awakened, excelling in knowledge and conduct, well-farer, knower of
worlds, incomparable trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and
humans, awakened, auspicious.” And from considering that confirmed
faith in the Buddha within yourself, those feelings may subside in this
place.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
In fact, O head of household, the form of faithlessness in the Dhamma that
the one to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a
puthujjana, is endowed with [because of which] with the breakup of the body,
after death, he reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the
woeful plane, hell, for you there is not that form of faithlessness in the
Dhamma. But for you, O head of household, there is confirmed faith in the
Dhamma [thus]: “The Dhamma is well-proclaimed by the Auspicious One,
visible in this life, not involving time, inviting inspection, leading
onward, to be comprehended by the wise, each one for one's self.”
And from considering that confirmed faith in the Dhamma within yourself,
those feelings may subside in this place.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
In fact, O head of household, the form of faithlessness in the Sangha that
the one to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a
puthujjana, is endowed with [because of which] with the breakup of the body,
after death, he reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the
woeful plane, hell, for you there is not that form of faithlessness in the
Sangha. But for you, O head of household, there is confirmed faith in the
Sangha [thus]: “The Sangha of the Auspicious One’s disciples has entered
upon the good path, the Sangha of the Auspicious One’s disciples has entered
upon the straight path, the Sangha of the Auspicious One’s disciples has
entered upon the true path, the Sangha of the Auspicious One’s disciples has
entered upon the proper path; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight
types of individuals. This Sangha of the Auspicious One’s disciples is
worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of
reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the
world.” And from considering that confirmed faith in the Sangha
within yourself, those feelings may subside in this place.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
In fact, O head of household, the form of immorality that the one to whom
the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a puthujjana, is endowed
with [because of which] with the breakup of the body, after death, he
reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane, hell,
for you there is not that form of immorality. But for you, O head of
household, there is the virtue dear to the noble ones [thus]: {}unbroken,
untorn, unmottled, unspeckled, freeing, praised by the wise, untarnished,
leading to samadhi.” And from considering that virtue dear to the
noble ones within yourself, those feelings may subside in this place.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
In fact, O head of household, the form of mistaken view that the one to whom
the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a puthujjana, is endowed
with [because of which] with the breakup of the body, after death, he
reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane, hell,
for you there is not that form of mistaken view. But for you, O head of
household, there is the right view. And from considering that right view
within yourself, those feelings may subside in this place.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
In fact, O head of household, the form of mistaken thought that the one to
whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a puthujjana, is
endowed with [because of which] with the breakup of the body, after death,
he reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane,
hell, for you there is not that form of mistaken thought. But for you, O
head of household, there is the right thought. And from considering that
right thought within yourself, those feelings may subside in this place.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
In fact, O head of household, the form of mistaken speech that the one to
whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a puthujjana, is
endowed with [because of which] with the breakup of the body, after death,
he reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane,
hell, for you there is not that form of mistaken speech. But for you, O head
of household, there is the right speech. And from considering that right
speech within yourself, those feelings may subside in this place.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
In fact, O head of household, the form of mistaken action that the one to
whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a puthujjana, is
endowed with [because of which] with the breakup of the body, after death,
he reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane,
hell, for you there is not that form of mistaken action. But for you, O head
of household, there is the right action. And from considering that right
action within yourself, those feelings may subside in this place.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
In fact, O head of household, the form of mistaken livelihood that the one
to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a puthujjana, is
endowed with [because of which] with the breakup of the body, after death,
he reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane,
hell, for you there is not that form of mistaken livelihood. But for you, O
head of household, there is the right livelihood. And from considering that
right livelihood within yourself, those feelings may subside in this place.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
In fact, O head of household, the form of mistaken effort that the one to
whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a puthujjana, is
endowed with [because of which] with the breakup of the body, after death,
he reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane,
hell, for you there is not that form of mistaken effort. But for you, O head
of household, there is the right effort. And from considering that right
effort within yourself, those feelings may subside in this place.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
In fact, O head of household, the form of mistaken mindfulness that the one
to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a puthujjana, is
endowed with [because of which] with the breakup of the body, after death,
he reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane,
hell, for you there is not that form of mistaken mindfulness. But for you, O
head of household, there is the right mindfulness. And from considering that
right mindfulness within yourself, those feelings may subside in this place.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
In fact, O head of household, the form of mistaken samadhi that the one to
whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a puthujjana, is
endowed with [because of which] with the breakup of the body, after death,
he reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane,
hell, for you there is not that form of mistaken samadhi. But for you, O
head of household, there is the right samadhi. And from considering that
right samadhi within yourself, those feelings may subside in this place.

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
In fact, O head of household, the form of mistaken knowledge that the one to
whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a puthujjana, is
endowed with [because of which] with the breakup of the body, after death,
he reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane,
hell, for you there is not that form of mistaken knowledge. But for you, O
head of household, there is the right knowledge. And from considering that
right knowledge within yourself, those feelings may subside in this place.

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
In fact, O head of household, the form of mistaken liberation that the one
to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does not come to be, a puthujjana, is
endowed with [because of which] with the breakup of the body, after death,
he reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy destination, the woeful plane,
hell, for you there is not that form of mistaken liberation. But for you, O
head of household, there is the right liberation. And from considering that
right liberation within yourself, those feelings may subside in this place.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
Then the feelings of Anathapindika, the head of household, subsided in that
place. Then Anathapindika, the head of household, served the venerable
Sariputta and the venerable Ananda with his very own dish of boiled
rice. Then, when the venerable Sariputta had eaten and removed his hand from
the bowl, Anathapindika, the head of household, having taken a certain lower
seat, sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the venerable
Sariputta rejoiced in [the generosity of] Anathapindika, the head of
household with these verses:

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Of whom faith in the Tathagata,<br> is well established, unshakeable;<br> of
whom there is goodness and virtue,<br> pleasing and agreeable to the noble
ones.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   Of whom there is faith in the Sangha,<br> and view that has come to be
straight;<br>they say that “such a one is not poor,”<br> that such
one's life is not in vain.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   Therefore faith and virtue,<br> confidence and vision of the Dhamma;<br> the
wise ones devote themselves to,<br> recollecting the Buddha's
teaching.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
Then the venerable Sariputta, having rejoiced in [the generosity of]
Anathapindika, the head of household with these verses, having risen up from
his seat, departed. Then by which [way led to] the Auspicious One, by that
way the venerable Ananda approached. Having approached the Auspicious One,
having bowed down, he sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the
Auspicious One ever said this to the venerable Ananda: “Well, from where,
O Ananda, are you coming from in the middle of the day.” Bhante,
the venerable Sariputta, has been advising Anathapindika, the head of
household, with such and such advise. “A wise one, O Ananda, is
Sariputta. Of great wisdom, O Ananda, is Sariputta, in as much as he can
indeed analyze the four factors of stream entry from ten aspects.”
