At one time Anathapindika, the head of household, was afflicted, in pain,
severely ill. Then Anathapindika, the head of household, addressed a certain
man: “Come you good man, visit with the venerable Sariputta. Upon
arrival, pay homage in my name [with your] head at the venerable Sariputta's
feet [and say:], Anathapindika, O Bhante, the head of household, is
afflicted, in pain, severely ill, he pays homage [with his] head at the
venerable Sariputta's feet.” Then speak thus: “[It would be]
really good, O Bhante, [if] the venerable Sariputta [would] stop by the
house of Anathapindika, the head of household, out of compassion.”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Yes sir, the man having replied Anathapindika, the head of household, he
visited with the venerable Sariputta. Upon arrival, he bowed down to the
venerable Sariputta and sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side,
the man said this to the venerable Sariputta: “Anathapindika, O Bhante,
the head of household, is afflicted, in pain, severely ill, he pays homage
[with his] head at the venerable Sariputta's feet.” And he says
thus: “[It would be] really good, O Bhante, [if] the venerable Sariputta
[would] stop by the house of Anathapindika, the head of household, out of
compassion.” The venerable Sariputta consented by silence.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
So then, in the morning, the venerable Sariputta, having dressed, having
taken bowl and robe, he stopped by the house of Anathapindika, the head of
household, with the venerable Ananda as his companion. Upon arrival, he sat
down on a prepared seat. Having sat down, the venerable Sariputta said this
to Anathapindika, the head of household: “I hope, O head of household,
that you are bearing up. I hope you are keeping on. I hope your painful
feelings are diminishing not increasing, and that their diminishing is
evident, not their increasing.” “For me, O Bhante, there is no
bearing up, no keeping on. For me severe painful feelings are increasing,
not diminishing, and their increasing is evident, not their
diminishing.”

But in fact, O head of household, the form of faithlessness in the Buddha

breakup of the body, after death, he reappears in the lower worlds, unhappy

the Arahant, rightly self-awakened, excelling in knowledge and conduct,
well-farer, knower of worlds, incomparable trainer of persons to be tamed,
teacher of devas and humans, awakened, auspicious.” And from

disciples has entered upon the good path, the Sangha of the Auspicious One’s
disciples has entered upon the straight path, the Sangha of the Auspicious
One’s disciples has entered upon the true path, the Sangha of the Auspicious
One’s disciples has entered upon the proper path; that is, the four pairs of
persons, the eight types of individuals. This Sangha of the Auspicious One’s
disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings,

you, O head of household, there is the virtue dear to the noble ones [thus]:

Then the feelings of Anathapindika, the head of household, subsided in that
place. Then Anathapindika, the head of household, served the venerable
Sariputta and the venerable Ananda with his very own dish of boiled
rice. Then, when the venerable Sariputta had eaten and removed his hand from
the bowl, Anathapindika, the head of household, having taken a certain lower
seat, sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the venerable
Sariputta rejoiced in [the generosity of] Anathapindika, the head of
household with these verses:

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Of whom faith in the Tathagata,<br> is well established, unshakeable;<br> of
whom there is goodness and virtue,<br> pleasing and agreeable to the noble
ones.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   Of whom there is faith in the Sangha,<br> and view that has come to be

one's life is not in vain.

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   Therefore faith and virtue,<br> confidence and vision of the Dhamma;<br> the
wise ones devote themselves to,<br> recollecting the Buddha's

</blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
Then the venerable Sariputta, having rejoiced in [the generosity of]
Anathapindika, the head of household with these verses, having risen up from
his seat, departed. Then the venerable Ananda went to the Auspicious
One. Upon arrival, he bowed down to the Auspicious One and sat down to one
side. Having sat down to one side, the Auspicious One said this to the
venerable Ananda: “Well, from where, O Ananda, are you coming from in the
middle of the day.” Bhante, the venerable Sariputta, has been
advising Anathapindika, the head of household, with such and such
advise. “A wise one, O Ananda, is Sariputta. Of great wisdom, O Ananda,
is Sariputta, in as much as he can indeed analyze the four factors of stream
entry from ten aspects.”
