Then, the venerable Malunkyaputta visited with the Auspicious One. Upon
arrival, he bowed down to the Auspicious One and sat down to one
side. Having sat down to one side, the venerable Malunkyaputta  said this to
the Auspicious One. “It would be good, O Bhante, if the Auspicious One
would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from
the Auspicious One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, vigilant, ardent,
resolute.”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“Here now, Malunkyaputta, what should we say to the young bhikkhus, in as
much as you, an aged bhikkhu, old, an old man, advanced in years, reached
decay, asks for advice in brief?” “I am aged, O Bhante, old, an
old man, advanced in years, reached decay, [but] somehow, let the Auspicious
One teach me the Dhamma in brief, O Bhante, let the Well-farer teach me the
Dhamma in brief. Perhaps I might understand the meaning of the Auspicious
One's statement. Perhaps I may become an heir of the Auspicious One's
statement.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
What do you think about that, Malunkyaputta:<br> Of forms cognizable by the
eye,<br> Those [forms] that have not been seen,<br> That have formally not been
seen,<br> That you're not seeing [now],<br> That you don't expect to see,<br>
Could there be desire or lust,<br> or love in relation to them?<br> Surely not,
venerable sir.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Of sounds cognizable by the ear,<br> Those [sounds] that have not been
heard,<br> That have formally not been heard,<br> That you're not hearing
[now],<br> That you don't expect to hear,<br> Could there be desire or lust,<br>
or love in relation to them?<br> Surely not, venerable sir.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Of aromas cognizable by the nose,<br> Those [aromas] that have not been
smelled,<br> That have formally not been smelled,<br> That you're not smelling
[now],<br> That you don't expect to smell,<br> Could there be desire or lust,<br>
or love in relation to them?<br> Surely not, venerable sir.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Of flavors cognizable by the tongue,<br> Those [flavors] that have not been
tasted,<br> That have formally not been tasted,<br> That you're not tasting
[now],<br> That you don't expect to taste,<br> Could there be desire or lust,<br>
or love in relation to them?<br> Surely not, venerable sir.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Of tangibles cognizable by the body,<br> Those [tangibles] that have not been
touched,<br> That have formally not been touched,<br> That you're not touching
[now],<br> That you don't expect to touch,<br> Could there be desire or lust,<br>
or love in relation to them?<br> Surely not, venerable sir.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Of dhammas cognizable by the mind,<br> Those [dhammas] that have not been
cognized,<br> That have formally not been cognized,<br> That you're not
cognizing [now],<br> That you don't expect to cognize,<br> Could there be desire
or lust,<br> or love in relation to them?<br> Surely not, venerable sir.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Here, for you Malunkyaputta, in regard to dhammas seen, heard, thought, or
cognized: “In the seen there will be merely the seen. In the heard there
will be merely the heard. In the thought there will be merely the
thought. In the cognized there will be merely the cognized.”
“Since for you Malunkyaputta, in regard to dhammas seen, heard, thought,
or cognized, in the seen there will be merely the seen, in the heard there
will be merely the heard, in the thought there will be merely the thought,
in the cognized there will be merely the cognized, therefore you
Malunkyaputta, are not that by which. Since you Malunkyaputta, are not that
by which, therefore you Malunkyaputta, are not in that place. Since you
Malunkyaputta, are not in that place, therefore you Malunkyaputta, are
neither in this world, nor in the other world, nor in between both
[worlds]. Just this is the end of suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Indeed, O Bhante, for this brief statement spoken by the Auspicious One, I
understand the meaning in detail.

what had to be done, there is no other for thusness.” And the
venerable Malunkyaputta became one of the arahants.
