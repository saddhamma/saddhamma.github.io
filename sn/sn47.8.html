Suppose, O bhikkhus, a foolish, incompetent, unskillful cook might present a
king or a king's minister with various servings of curry [flavors]: with
distinctly sour, also with distinctly bitter, also with distinctly pungent,
also with distinctly sweet, also with spicy, also with mild, also with
salty, also with unsalted.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
O bhikkhus, that foolish, incompetent, unskillful cook does not grasp the
sign of his own master: today, my master found this curry fit to delight in,
or reached for this, or took much of this, or spoke in praise of this, or
today my master found the distinctly sour curry fit to delight in, or
reached for the distinctly sour, or took much of the distinctly sour, or
spoke in praise of the distinctly sour, or today my master found the
distinctly bitter curry fit to delight in, or reached for the distinctly
bitter, or took much of the distinctly bitter, or spoke in praise of the
distinctly bitter, or today my master found the distinctly pungent curry fit
to delight in, or reached for the distinctly pungent, or took much of the
distinctly pungent, or spoke in praise of the distinctly pungent, or today
my master found the distinctly sweet curry fit to delight in, or reached for
the distinctly sweet, or took much of the distinctly sweet, or spoke in
praise of the distinctly sweet, or today my master found the spicy curry fit
to delight in, or reached for the spicy, or took much of the spicy, or spoke
in praise of the spicy, or today my master found the mild curry fit to
delight in, or reached for the mild, or took much of the mild, or spoke in
praise of the mild, or today my master found the salty curry fit to delight
in, or reached for the salty, or took much of the salty, or spoke in praise
of the salty, or today my master found the unsalted curry fit to delight in,
or reached for the unsalted, or took much of the unsalted, or spoke in
praise of the unsalted. Now, O bhikkhus, that foolish, incompetent,
unskillful cook just becomes not a gainer of clothing, not a gainer of
wages, not a gainer of offerings. What is the reason for that? Because, O
bhikkhus, he being thus foolish, incompetent, unskillful cook, does not
grasp the sign of his own master.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
It is just so, O bhikkhus, here, a certain foolish, incompetent, unskillful
bhikkhu dwells in the body not perceiving in accordance with the body as an
ardent, contemplative and mindful one having put away worldly covetousness
and longing. Of him dwelling in the body as not one who perceives in
accordance with the body, the mind does not attain samadhi, the defilements
are not abandoned, he does not grasp that sign. He dwells in feelings not
perceiving in accordance with feelings as an ardent, contemplative and
mindful one having put away worldly covetousness and longing. Of him
dwelling in feelings as not one who perceives in accordance with feelings,
the mind does not attain samadhi, the defilements are not abandoned, he does
not grasp that sign. He dwells in states of mind not perceiving in
accordance with states of mind as an ardent, contemplative and mindful one
having put away worldly covetousness and longing. Of him dwelling in states
of mind as not one who perceives in accordance with states of mind, the mind
does not attain samadhi, the defilements are not abandoned, he does not
grasp that sign. He dwells in dhammas not perceiving in accordance with
dhammas as an ardent, contemplative and mindful one having put away worldly
covetousness and longing. Of him dwelling in dhammas as not one who
perceives in accordance with dhammas, the mind does not attain samadhi, the
defilements are not abandoned, he does not grasp that sign. Now, O bhikkhus,
that foolish, incompetent, unskillful bhikkhu just becomes not a gainer of
pleasant dwelling here and now, not a gainer of mindfulness and
contemplative. What is the reason for that? Because, O bhikkhus, he being
thus foolish, incompetent, unskillful bhikkhu, does not grasp the sign of
his own mind.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Suppose, O bhikkhus, a wise, accomplished, skillful cook might present a
king or a king's minister with various servings of curry [flavors]: with
distinctly sour, also with distinctly bitter, also with distinctly pungent,
also with distinctly sweet, also with spicy, also with mild, also with
salty, also with unsalted.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
O bhikkhus, that wise, competent, skillful cook grasps the sign of his own
master: today, my master found this curry fit to delight in, or reached for
this, or took much of this, or spoke in praise of this, or today my master
found the distinctly sour curry fit to delight in, or reached for the
distinctly sour, or took much of the distinctly sour, or spoke in praise of
the distinctly sour, or today my master found the distinctly bitter curry
fit to delight in, or reached for the distinctly bitter, or took much of the
distinctly bitter, or spoke in praise of the distinctly bitter, or today my
master found the distinctly pungent curry fit to delight in, or reached for
the distinctly pungent, or took much of the distinctly pungent, or spoke in
praise of the distinctly pungent, or today my master found the distinctly
sweet curry fit to delight in, or reached for the distinctly sweet, or took
much of the distinctly sweet, or spoke in praise of the distinctly sweet, or
today my master found the spicy curry fit to delight in, or reached for the
spicy, or took much of the spicy, or spoke in praise of the spicy, or today
my master found the mild curry fit to delight in, or reached for the mild,
or took much of the mild, or spoke in praise of the mild, or today my master
found the salty curry fit to delight in, or reached for the salty, or took
much of the salty, or spoke in praise of the salty, or today my master found
the unsalted curry fit to delight in, or reached for the unsalted, or took
much of the unsalted, or spoke in praise of the unsalted. Now, O bhikkhus,
that wise, competent, skillful cook just becomes a gainer of clothing, a
gainer of wages, a gainer of offerings. What is the reason for that?
Because, O bhikkhus, he being thus wise, competent, skillful cook, grasps
the sign of his own master.
