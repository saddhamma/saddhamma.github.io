Thus was heard by me. At one time, the Auspicious One was living at Rājagaha
at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel's Feeding Place. At that time the
venerable Godhika was living at the Black Rock on the Isigili Slope. It so
happened that while the venerable Godhika was dwelling ever vigilant, ardent
and resolute, he attained a temporary liberation by state of mind. Then the
venerable Godhika fell away from that temporary liberation by state of mind.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Also for a second time, while the venerable Godhika was dwelling ever
vigilant, ardent and resolute, he attained a temporary liberation by state
of mind. Also for a second time, the venerable Godhika fell away from that
temporary liberation by state of mind. Also for a third time, the venerable
Godhika fell away from that temporary liberation by state of mind. Also for
a fourth time, the venerable Godhika fell away from that temporary
liberation by state of mind. Also for a fifth time, the venerable Godhika
fell away from that temporary liberation by state of mind. Also for a sixth
time, the venerable Godhika fell away from that temporary liberation by
state of mind.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Also for a seventh time, while the venerable Godhika was dwelling ever
vigilant, ardent and resolute, he attained a temporary liberation by state
of mind. Then of the venerable Godhika, this occured to him: Indeed I fallen
away from temporary liberation by state of mind as much as the sixth
time. What if I were to use the knife?

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
So then, Mara the evil one, having known the reflection in the venerable
Godhika's mind with his own mind, went to the Auspicious One. Upon arrival,
he addressed the Auspicious One in verses:

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “O great hero, one of great wisdom,<br> shining with psychic powers and
glory;<br> One who has overcome all enmity and fear,<br> I pay homage at your
feet, O All-seeing One.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   Your disciple O great hero,<br> it is death, O conqueror of death;<br> he wishes
for and thinks of,<br> prevent him from that O Luminous One.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   How indeed O Auspicious One, of yours,<br> a disciple who delights in the
instructions,<br> one in higher training who has not obtained his intention,<br>
take his own life, O widely famed.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
By that time the venerable Godhika had used the knife.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
So then the Auspicious One having known, this is Mara, the evil one,
addressed Mara, the evil one, in verse thus:

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Thus indeed [is how] the wise ones act,<br> they do not wish to strive
after life;<br> Having removed the root of craving,<br> Godhika has attained
nibbana.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Then the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus: “Come, O bhikkhus, let us
stop by the Black Rock on Isigili Slope where the young clansman, Godhika,
has used the knife.” “Yes Bhante,” those bhikkhus
replied to the Auspicious One. So then, the Auspicious One stopped by the
Black Rock on Isigili Slope, along with many bhikkhus. The Auspicious One
saw the venerable Godhika from a distant lying down on a small bed with his
body turned around.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
At that time, a [cloud of] darkness, clouding over, just moved to the
eastern direction, moved to the western direction, moved to the northern
direction, moved to the southern direction, moved above, moved below, moved
to the intermediate directions.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Then the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus: Do you see O bhikkhus, this
[cloud of] darkness, clouding over, as it moves to the eastern direction,
moves to the western direction, moves to the northern direction, moves to
the southern direction, moves above, moves below, moves to the intermediate
directions? “Yes Bhante.” O bhikkhus, it is really Mara, the
evil one, searching for the consciousness of the young clansman, Godhika;
[wondering:] “Where is the consciousness of the young clansman, Godhika,
established?” “But with consciousness unestablished, O bhikkhus,
the young clansman, Godhika has attained nibbana.”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Later on, Mara the evil one, having taken a yellow beluva lute, went to the
Auspicious One. Upon arrival, he addressed the Auspicious One in a verse:

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   Above, below and across,<br> in the [four] quarters and the intermediate
directions;<br> I have been searching for but cannot find,<br> where Godhika has
arrived at.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   (the Auspicious One:)<br> That wise man, one excelling in energy,<br> a
meditator always delighting in jhana;<br> endeavoring accordingly day and
night,<br> with no desires [even] for life.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   Having cut off the army of death,<br> not having returned to renewal of
being;<br> Having removed the root of craving,<br> Godhika has attained
nibbana.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   (therā:)<br> “Of him [thus] overcome with grief,<br> his lute fell down from
his armpit;<br> thence that spirit [being] sad,<br> disappeared right
there.”
