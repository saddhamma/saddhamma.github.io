At Savatthi

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Then a certain bhikkhu visited with the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, he
bowed down to the Auspicious One and sat down to one side. Having sat down
to one side, that bhikkhu said this to the Auspicious One: “Ignorance,
ignorance” O Bhante, it is said. What, O Bhante, is ignorance? To
what extent is one entrenched in ignorance?

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“Here O Bhikkhu, the Dhamma-deaf puthujjana does not wisely understand as
it has come to be “form is of a nature to arise as form is of a nature to
arise.” He does not wisely understand as it has come to be “form
is of a nature to vanish as form is of a nature to vanish.” He does
not wisely understand as it has come to be “form is of a nature to arise
and vanish as form is of a nature to arise and vanish.” He does not
wisely understand as it has come to be “feeling is of a nature to arise
as feeling is of a nature to arise.” He does not wisely understand
as it has come to be “feeling is of a nature to vanish as feeling is of a
nature to vanish.” He does not wisely understand as it has come to
be “feeling is of a nature to arise and vanish as feeling is of a nature
to arise and vanish.” He does not wisely understand as it has come
to be “perception is of a nature to arise as perception is of a nature to
arise.” He does not wisely understand as it has come to be
“perception is of a nature to vanish as perception is of a nature to
vanish.” He does not wisely understand as it has come to be
“perception is of a nature to arise and vanish as perception is of a
nature to arise and vanish.” He does not wisely understand as it
has come to be “sankharas are of a nature to arise as sankharas are of a
nature to arise.” He does not wisely understand as it has come to
be “sankharas are of a nature to vanish as sankharas are of a nature to
vanish.” He does not wisely understand as it has come to be
“sankharas are of a nature to arise and vanish as sankharas are of a
nature to arise and vanish.” He does not wisely understand as it
has come to be “consciousess is of a nature to arise as consciousess is
of a nature to arise.” He does not wisely understand as it has come
to be “consciousess is of a nature to vanish as consciousess is of a
nature to vanish.” He does not wisely understand as it has come to
be “consciousess is of a nature to arise and vanish as consciousess is of
a nature to arise and vanish.” This, O Bhikkhu, is called
ignorance. It is to this extent that one is entrenched in
ignorance.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
When thus was said, that bhikkhu said this to the Auspicious One. “noble
knowledge, noble knowledge,” O Bhante, it is said. What, O Bhante,
is noble knowledge? To what extent is one entrenched in noble knowledge?

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
“Here O Bhikkhu, the Dhamma-hearer, the noble disciple, wisely
understands as it has come to be “form is of a nature to arise as form is
of a nature to arise.” He wisely understands as it has come to be
“form is of a nature to vanish as form is of a nature to
vanish.” He wisely understands as it has come to be “form is of
a nature to arise and vanish as form is of a nature to arise and
vanish.” He wisely understands as it has come to be “feeling is
of a nature to arise as feeling is of a nature to arise.” He wisely
understands as it has come to be “feeling is of a nature to vanish as
feeling is of a nature to vanish.” He wisely understands as it has
come to be “feeling is of a nature to arise and vanish as feeling is of a
nature to arise and vanish.” He wisely understands as it has come
to be “perception is of a nature to arise as perception is of a nature to
arise.” He wisely understands as it has come to be “perception
is of a nature to vanish as perception is of a nature to vanish.”
He wisely understands as it has come to be “perception is of a nature to
arise and vanish as perception is of a nature to arise and vanish.”
He wisely understands as it has come to be “sankharas are of a nature to
arise as sankharas are of a nature to arise.” He wisely understands
as it has come to be “sankharas are of a nature to vanish as sankharas
are of a nature to vanish.” He wisely understands as it has come to
be “sankharas are of a nature to arise and vanish as sankharas are of a
nature to arise and vanish.” He wisely understands as it has come
to be “consciousess is of a nature to arise as consciousess is of a
nature to arise.” He wisely understands as it has come to be
“consciousess is of a nature to vanish as consciousess is of a nature to
vanish.” He wisely understands as it has come to be
“consciousess is of a nature to arise and vanish as consciousess is of a
nature to arise and vanish.” This, O Bhikkhu, is called noble
knowledge. It is to this extent that one is entrenched in noble
knowledge.”
