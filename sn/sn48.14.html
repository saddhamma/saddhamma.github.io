There are, O bhikkhus, these five faculties. Which five? The faith faculty,
the energy faculty, the mindfulness faculty, the samadhi faculty, the wisdom
faculty. These, O bhikkhus, are the five faculties. O bhikkhus, from the
completeness and fulfillment of these five faculties, one is an arahant.

Weaker than that, one is an anagami. Weaker than that, one is a
sakadagami. Weaker than that, one is a sotapanna. Weaker than that, one is a

bhikkhus, a doer in full succeeds in full. A doer in part succeeds in
part. These five faculties, O bhikkhus, are clearly not barren, I
say.”
