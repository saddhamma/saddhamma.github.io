Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling among the
Kurus in a market town called Kammasadamma. At that place the Auspicious One
addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus.” “Bhante,” those
bhikkhus replied to the Auspicious One. The Auspicious One said this:

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Do you, O bhikkhus, engage in inward exploration? When thus was said, a
certain bhikkhu said this to the Auspicious One: I, O Bhante, engage in
inward exploration. But how, O bhikkhu, do you engage in inward exploration?
That bhikkhu answered but his answer did not satisfy the Auspicious One.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
When thus was said, the venerable Ananda said this to the Auspicious One:
“This is the appropriate time, O Auspicious One, this is the appropriate
time, O Well-farer, the Auspicious One should speak about inward
exploration. Having heard from the Auspicious One, the bhikkhus will bear it
in mind.”“Well then, O Ananda, listen and do mind it well. I
will speak.”“Yes Bhante.” Those bhikkhus replied to the
Auspicious One. The Auspicious One said this:

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu thoroughly exploring, explores inwardly thus:
“The diverse and numerous kinds of sufferings which arise here in the
world [including] old age and death, what is this suffering's source, what
is its origin, from what is it born, from what does it arise, when there is
what within does old age and death come to be, when there is not what within
does old age and death not come to be?”Exploring, he wisely
understands thus: “The diverse and numerous kinds of sufferings which
arise here in the world [including] old age and death, this suffering has
possession as its source, possession as its origin, it is born from
possession, it arises from possession; when there is possession within, old
age and death come to be, when there is not possession within, old age and
death does not come to be.” He wisely understands old age and
death, and he wisely understands the origination of old age and death, and
he wisely understands the cessation of old age and death, and that which is
the path that properly leads to the cessation of old age and death, that too
he wisely understands. So he has entered upon the path and is one whose
conduct accords with the Dhamma. This, O bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu  who
has entered upon the right path for the destruction of all suffering, for
the cessation of old age and death.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Thoroughly exploring further, he explores inwardly thus: ““But this
possession, what is its source, what is its origin, from what is it born,
from what does it arise, when there is what within does possession comes to
be, when there is not what within does possession not come to
be?”Exploring, he wisely understands thus: “possession have
thirsting as its source, thirsting as its origin, it is born from thirsting,
it arises from thirsting; when there is thirsting within, possession comes
to be, when there is not thirsting within, possession does not come to
be.”He wisely understands possession, and he wisely understands the
origination of possession, and he wisely understands the cessation of
possession, and that which is the path that properly leads to the cessation
of possession, that too he wisely understands. So he has entered upon the
path and is one whose conduct accords with the Dhamma. This, O bhikkhus, is
called a bhikkhu  who has entered upon the right path for the destruction of
all suffering, for the cessation of possession.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Thoroughly exploring further, he explores inwardly thus: “But this
thirsting, where does it arise when arising, where does it settle when
settling?” Exploring, he wisely understands thus: “Whatever in
the world is enticing and pleasing, here this thirsting arises when arising,
here it settles when settling. But what in the world is enticing and
pleasing? The eye in the world is enticing and pleasing. Here that thirsting
arises when arising, here it settles when settling. The ear in the world is
enticing and pleasing. Here that thirsting arises when arising, here it
settles when settling. The nose in the world is enticing and pleasing. Here
that thirsting arises when arising, here it settles when settling. The
tongue in the world is enticing and pleasing. Here that thirsting arises
when arising, here it settles when settling. The body in the world is
enticing and pleasing. Here that thirsting arises when arising, here it
settles when settling. The mind in the world is enticing and pleasing. Here
that thirsting arises when arising, here it settles when settling.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
“Indeed, O bhikkhus, whatever samanas or brahmanas in the past saw that
which in the world is enticing and pleasing, as permanent, as pleasurable,
as self, as healthy, as secure, they nurtured thirsting. Those who nurtured
thirsting, they nurtured possession. Those who nurtured possession, they
nurtured suffering. Those who nurtured suffering, they were not freed from
birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental
suffering, and despair. They were not freed from suffering, I say.”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
“Indeed, O bhikkhus, whatever samanas or brahmanas in the future will see
that which in the world is enticing and pleasing, as permanent, as
pleasurable, as self, as healthy, as secure, they will nurture
thirsting. Those who will nurture thirsting, they will nurture
possession. Those who will nurture possession, they will nurture
suffering. Those who will nurture suffering, they will not be freed from
birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental
suffering, and despair. They will not be freed from suffering, I
say.”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
“Indeed, O bhikkhus, whatever samanas or brahmanas at present see that
which in the world is enticing and pleasing, as permanent, as pleasurable,
as self, as healthy, as secure, they are nurturing thirsting. Those who are
nurturing thirsting, they are nurturing possession. Those who are nurturing
possession, they are nurturing suffering. Those who are nurturing suffering,
they are not freed from birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, physical
suffering, mental suffering, and despair. They are not freed from suffering,
I say.”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Suppose, O bhikkhus, a beverage in a vessel would be endowed with color,
aroma, and flavor but mixed with poison. A man would come along overpowered
by the burning sun, afflicted with heat, exhausted, dehydrated and longing
for a drink. They would say to him thus: “This beverage in the vessel,
Good man, is endowed with color, aroma, and flavor but mixed with
poison. Drink it if you wish. Indeed while drinking, the color, the aroma
and also the flavor will give you pleasure. But having drunk it as the
cause, you will meet with death or deadly suffering.” He would
hurriedly, without reflection, drink that beverage and not relinquish
it. With that is the cause, he would meet with death or deadly suffering.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
“So too, O bhikkhus, whatever samanas or brahmanas in the past saw that
which in the world is enticing and pleasing, as permanent, as pleasurable,
as self, as healthy, as secure, they nurtured thirsting. Those who nurtured
thirsting, they nurtured possession. Those who nurtured possession, they
nurtured suffering. Those who nurtured suffering, they were not freed from
birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental
suffering, and despair. They were not freed from suffering, I say.”

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
“Indeed, O bhikkhus, whatever samanas or brahmanas in the future will see
that which in the world is enticing and pleasing, as permanent, as
pleasurable, as self, as healthy, as secure, they will nurture
thirsting. Those who will nurture thirsting, they will nurture
possession. Those who will nurture possession, they will nurture
suffering. Those who will nurture suffering, they will not be freed from
birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental
suffering, and despair. They will not be freed from suffering, I
say.”

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
“Indeed, O bhikkhus, whatever samanas or brahmanas at present see that

nurturing thirsting, they are nurturing possession. Those who are nurturing
possession, they are nurturing suffering. Those who are nurturing suffering,
they are not freed from birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, physical
suffering, mental suffering, and despair. They are not freed from suffering,
I say.”

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
“Indeed, O bhikkhus, whatever samanas or brahmanas in the past saw that
which in the world is enticing and pleasing, as impermanent, as suffering,
as non-self, as a disease, as danger, they abandoned thirsting. Those who
abandoned thirsting, they abandoned possession. Those who abandoned
possession, they abandoned suffering. Those who abandoned suffering, they
were freed from birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, physical
suffering, mental suffering, and despair. They were freed from suffering, I
say.”

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
“Indeed, O bhikkhus, whatever samanas or brahmanas in the future will see
that which in the world is enticing and pleasing, as impermanent, as
suffering, as non-self, as a disease, as danger, they will abandon
thirsting. Those who will abandon thirsting, they will abandon
possession. Those who will abandon possession, they will abandon
suffering. Those who will abandon suffering, they will be freed from birth,
old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental suffering,
and despair. They will be freed from suffering, I say.”

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
“Indeed, O bhikkhus, whatever samanas or brahmanas at present see that
which in the world is enticing and pleasing, as impermanent, as suffering,
as non-self, as a disease, as danger, they abandon thirsting. Those who
abandon thirsting, they abandon possession. Those who abandon possession,
they abandon suffering. Those who abandon suffering, they are freed from
birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental
suffering, and despair. They are freed from suffering, I say.”

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
Suppose, O bhikkhus, a beverage in a vessel would be endowed with color,
aroma, and flavor but mixed with poison. A man would come along overpowered
by the burning sun, afflicted with heat, exhausted, dehydrated and longing
for a drink. They would say to him: “This beverage in a vessel, good man,
is endowed with color, aroma, and flavor but mixed with poison. Drink it if
you wish. Indeed while drinking, the color, the aroma and also the flavor
will give you pleasure. But having drunk it as the cause, you will meet with
death or deadly suffering.” Then, O bhikkhus, it would occur to the
man thus: “It is possible for me to dispel this longing for a drink with
water, or to dispel it with whey, or to dispel it with salty soup or to
dispel it with salty sour gruel. But I definately should not drink this
beverage, which will lead to my long term harm and suffering.” With
reflection, he would not drink that beverage [but] would relinguish it. With
that as cause, he will not meet with death or deadly suffering.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
“So too, O bhikkhus, whatever samanas or brahmanas in the past saw that
which in the world is enticing and pleasing, as impermanent, as suffering,
as non-self, as a disease, as danger, they abandoned thirsting. Those who
abandoned thirsting, they abandoned possession. Those who abandoned
possession, they abandoned suffering. Those who abandoned suffering, they
were freed from birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, physical
suffering, mental suffering, and despair. They were freed from suffering, I
say.”

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
“Indeed, O bhikkhus, whatever samanas or brahmanas in the future will see
that which in the world is enticing and pleasing, as impermanent, as
suffering, as non-self, as a disease, as danger, they will abandon
thirsting. Those who will abandon thirsting, they will abandon
possession. Those who will abandon possession, they will abandon
suffering. Those who will abandon suffering, they will be freed from birth,
old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental suffering,
and despair. They will be freed from suffering, I say.”
