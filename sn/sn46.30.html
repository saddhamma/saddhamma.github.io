At one time the Auspicious One lived among the Sumbhas, in a market town
named Setaka. Then the venerable Udayi visited with the Auspicious One. Upon
arrival, he bowed down to the Auspicious One and sat down to one
side. Having sat down to one side, the venerable Udayi said this to the
Auspicious One: It is marvellous, O Bhante. It is unprecedented, O Bhante,
how profitable, O Bhante, my affection, reverence, moral dignity and moral
dread for the Auspicious One has been. Indeed O Bhante, formerly while being
a householder, I did not profit by the Dhamma, did not profit by the
Sangha. [It is profitable] that indeed I, O Bhante, considering my
affection, reverence, moral dignity and moral dread for the Auspicious One,
went forth from the house [life] into homelessness; [profitable] that for
me, the Auspicious One taught the Dhamma [thus]: “Such is form, such is
form's arising, such is form's disappearance, such is feeling, such is
feeling's arising, such is feeling's disappearance, such is perception, such
is perception's arising, such is perception's disappearance, such are
sankharas, such are sankharas' arising, such are sankharas' disappearance,
such is consciousness, such is consciousness's arising, such is
consciousness's disappearance;” [profitable] that indeed I, O
Bhante, gone to an empty hut, setting in motion the restoration and
inversion in these five stocks of appropriation, understood with higher
knowledge as it has come to be: “This is suffering;” understood
with higher knowledge as it has come to be: “This is the origin of
suffering;” understood with higher knowledge as it has come to be:
“This is the cessation of suffering;” understood with higher
knowledge as it has come to be: “This is the means for progress leading
to the cessation of suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
The breakthrough to the Dhamma has been made by me, O Bhante, and the path
has been obtained by me which when matured, made abundant by me dwelling in
the appropriate way, will lead [me] onwards to the state of being thus, as I
will understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity, done
is what had to be done, there is no other for thusness.” The
awakening factor of mindfulness, O Bhante, has been obtained by me which
when matured, made abundant by me dwelling in the appropriate way, will lead
[me] onwards to the state of being thus, as I will understand: “Destroyed
is birth, lived is the life of purity, done is what had to be done, there is
no other for thusness.” The awakening factor of investigation of
dhammas, O Bhante, has been obtained by me which when matured, made abundant
by me dwelling in the appropriate way, will lead [me] onwards to the state
of being thus, as I will understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the
life of purity, done is what had to be done, there is no other for
thusness.” The awakening factor of energy, O Bhante, has been
obtained by me which when matured, made abundant by me dwelling in the
appropriate way, will lead [me] onwards to the state of being thus, as I
will understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity, done
is what had to be done, there is no other for thusness.” The
awakening factor of rapture, O Bhante, has been obtained by me which when
matured, made abundant by me dwelling in the appropriate way, will lead [me]
onwards to the state of being thus, as I will understand: “Destroyed is
birth, lived is the life of purity, done is what had to be done, there is no
other for thusness.” The awakening factor of tranquility, O Bhante,
has been obtained by me which when matured, made abundant by me dwelling in
the appropriate way, will lead [me] onwards to the state of being thus, as I
will understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity, done
is what had to be done, there is no other for thusness.” The
awakening factor of samadhi, O Bhante, has been obtained by me which when
matured, made abundant by me dwelling in the appropriate way, will lead [me]
onwards to the state of being thus, as I will understand: “Destroyed is
birth, lived is the life of purity, done is what had to be done, there is no
other for thusness.” The awakening factor of equanimity, O Bhante,
has been obtained by me which when matured, made abundant by me dwelling in
the appropriate way, will lead [me] onwards to the state of being thus, as I
will understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity, done
is what had to be done, there is no other for thusness.” This, O
Bhante, is the path having been obtained by me which when matured, made
abundant by me dwelling in the appropriate way, will lead [me] onwards to
the state of being thus, as I will understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived
is the life of purity, done is what had to be done, there is no other for
thusness.”

Good, good Udayi. This indeed, O Udayi, is the path having been obtained by
you which when matured, made abundant by you dwelling in the appropriate
way, will lead [you] onwards to the state of being thus, as you will
understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity, done is
what had to be done, there is no other for thusness.”

At one time the Auspicious One lived among the Sumbhas, in a market town
named Setaka. Then the venerable Udayi visited with the Auspicious One. Upon
arrival, he bowed down to the Auspicious One and sat down to one
side. Having sat down to one side, the venerable Udayi said this to the
Auspicious One: It is marvellous, O Bhante. It is unprecedented, O Bhante,
how profitable, O Bhante, my affection, reverence, sense of shame and fear
of wrongdoing for the Auspicious One has been. Indeed O Bhante, formerly
while being a householder, I did not profit by the Dhamma, did not profit by
the Sangha. [It is profitable] that indeed I, O Bhante, considering my
affection, reverence, sense of shame and fear of wrongdoing for the
Auspicious One, went forth from the house [life] into homelessness;
[profitable] that for me, the Auspicious One taught the Dhamma [thus]:
“Such is form, such is form's arising, such is form's disappearance, such
is feeling, such is feeling's arising, such is feeling's disappearance, such
is perception, such is perception's arising, such is perception's
disappearance, such are sankharas, such are sankharas' arising, such are
sankharas' disappearance, such is consciousness, such is consciousness's
arising, such is consciousness's disappearance;” [profitable] that
indeed I, O Bhante, gone to an empty hut, setting in motion the restoration
and inversion in these five stocks of appropriation, understood with higher
knowledge as it has come to be: “This is suffering;” understood
with higher knowledge as it has come to be: “This is the origin of
suffering;” understood with higher knowledge as it has come to be:
“This is the cessation of suffering;” understood with higher
knowledge as it has come to be: “This is the means for progress leading
to the cessation of suffering.”

The breakthrough to the Dhamma has been made by me, O Bhante, and the path
has been obtained by me which when matured, made abundant by me dwelling in
the appropriate way, will lead [me] onwards to the state of being thus, as I
will understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity, done
is what had to be done, there is no other for thusness.” The
awakening factor of mindfulness, O Bhante, has been obtained by me which
when matured, made abundant by me dwelling in the appropriate way, will lead
[me] onwards to the state of being thus, as I will understand: “Destroyed
is birth, lived is the life of purity, done is what had to be done, there is
no other for thusness.” The awakening factor of investigation of
dhammas, O Bhante, has been obtained by me which when matured, made abundant
by me dwelling in the appropriate way, will lead [me] onwards to the state
of being thus, as I will understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the
life of purity, done is what had to be done, there is no other for
thusness.” The awakening factor of energy, O Bhante, has been
obtained by me which when matured, made abundant by me dwelling in the
appropriate way, will lead [me] onwards to the state of being thus, as I
will understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity, done
is what had to be done, there is no other for thusness.” The
awakening factor of rapture, O Bhante, has been obtained by me which when
matured, made abundant by me dwelling in the appropriate way, will lead [me]
onwards to the state of being thus, as I will understand: “Destroyed is
birth, lived is the life of purity, done is what had to be done, there is no
other for thusness.” The awakening factor of tranquility, O Bhante,
has been obtained by me which when matured, made abundant by me dwelling in
the appropriate way, will lead [me] onwards to the state of being thus, as I
will understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity, done
is what had to be done, there is no other for thusness.” The
awakening factor of samadhi, O Bhante, has been obtained by me which when
matured, made abundant by me dwelling in the appropriate way, will lead [me]
onwards to the state of being thus, as I will understand: “Destroyed is
birth, lived is the life of purity, done is what had to be done, there is no
other for thusness.” The awakening factor of equanimity, O Bhante,
has been obtained by me which when matured, made abundant by me dwelling in
the appropriate way, will lead [me] onwards to the state of being thus, as I
will understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity, done
is what had to be done, there is no other for thusness.” This, O
Bhante, is the path having been obtained by me which when matured, made
abundant by me dwelling in the appropriate way, will lead [me] onwards to
the state of being thus, as I will understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived
is the life of purity, done is what had to be done, there is no other for
thusness.”

Good, good Udayi. This indeed, O Udayi, is the path having been obtained by
you which when matured, made abundant by you dwelling in the appropriate
way, will lead [you] onwards to the state of being thus, as you will
understand: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity, done is
what had to be done, there is no other for thusness.”
