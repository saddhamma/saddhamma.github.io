<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me. At one time the venerable Sariputta was dwelling in
Savatthi at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
At that time, such a form of evil entrenchment in view had arisen for a
bhikkhu named Yamaka thus: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the
Auspicious One, from the breakup of the body, a bhikkhu with asavas
destroyed becomes annihilated and destroyed and does not exist after
death.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Many bhikkhus heard, apparently, such a form of evil entrenchment in view
has arisen for a bhikkhu named Yamaka thus: “As I understand the Dhamma
taught by the Auspicious One, from the breakup of the body, a bhikkhu with
asavas destroyed becomes annihilated and destroyed and does not exist after
death.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
So then, by which way [led to] the venerable Yamaka, by that way those
bhikkhus approached. Having approached the venerable Yamaka, they exchanged
friendly greetings. Having exchanged friendly greetings and cordial talk,
they sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, those bhikkhus said
this to the venerable Yamaka: “Is it true as reported, for you O friend
Yamaka, such a form of evil entrenchment in view has arisen thus: “As I
understand the Dhamma taught by the Auspicious One, from the breakup of the
body, a bhikkhu with asavas destroyed becomes annihilated and destroyed and
does not exist after death.””

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Yes, O friends. “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Auspicious One,
from the breakup of the body, a bhikkhu with asavas destroyed becomes
annihilated and destroyed and does not exist after death.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Do not say so, O friend Yamaka, to misrepresent the Auspicious One. Indeed,
the misrepresentation of the Auspicious One is not good. The Auspicious One
would certainly not say thus: “From the breakup of the body, a bhikkhu
with asavas destroyed becomes annihilated and destroyed and does not exist
after death.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Even [while] those bhikkhus were saying thus, the venerable Yamaka still
obstinately adhered to [and] expressed that same evil entrenchment in view:
“As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Auspicious One, from the
breakup of the body, a bhikkhu with asavas destroyed becomes annihilated and
destroyed and does not exist after death.”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Since those bhikkhus were unable to detach the venerable Yamaka from this
evil entrenchment in view, so then, having risen up from their seats, by
which way [led to] the venerable Sariputta, by that way they
approached. Having approached, they said this to the venerable Sariputta. O
friend Sariputta, an evil entrenchment in view has arisen for the bhikkhu
named Yamaka thus: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Auspicious
One, from the breakup of the body, a bhikkhu with asavas destroyed becomes
annihilated and destroyed and does not exist after death.” “[It
would be] good, [if] the venerable Sariputta [would] approach the bhikkhu
Yamaka, out of compassion.” The venerable Sariputta consented by
silence.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Then in the evening time, the venerable Sariputta emerged from
seclusion. [Then] by which way [led to] the venerable Yamaka, by that way he
approached. Having approached the venerable Yamaka, they exchanged friendly
greetings. Having exchanged friendly greetings and cordial talk, he sat down
to one side. Having sat down to one side, the venerable Sariputta said this
to the venerable Yamaka: Is it true as reported, for you O friend Yamaka,
such a form of evil entrenchment in view has arisen thus? “As I
understand the Dhamma taught by the Auspicious One, from the breakup of the
body, a bhikkhu with asavas destroyed becomes annihilated and destroyed and
does not exist after death.”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
But of course, friend. “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the
Auspicious One, from the breakup of the body, a bhikkhu with asavas
destroyed becomes annihilated and destroyed and does not exist after
death.”

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
“So what do you think, O friend Yamaka? Is form permanent or
impermanent?” Impermanent, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
“But that which is impermanent, is that suffering or happiness?
Suffering, O friend.”

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
“But that which is impermanent, suffering, and liable to change, is that
proper to recognize [as] “This is mine, this I am, this is
myself?” Certainly not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
“Is feeling permanent or impermanent?” Impermanent, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
“But that which is impermanent, is that suffering or happiness?
Suffering, O friend.”

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
“But that which is impermanent, suffering, and liable to change, is that
proper to recognize [as] “This is mine, this I am, this is
myself?” Certainly not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
“Is perception permanent or impermanent?” Impermanent, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
“But that which is impermanent, is that suffering or happiness?
Suffering, O friend.”

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
“But that which is impermanent, suffering, and liable to change, is that
proper to recognize [as] “This is mine, this I am, this is
myself?” Certainly not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
“Are sankharas permanent or impermanent?” Impermanent, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
“But that which is impermanent, is that suffering or happiness?
Suffering, O friend.”

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
“But that which is impermanent, suffering, and liable to change, is that
proper to recognize [as] “This is mine, this I am, this is
myself?” Certainly not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
“Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?” Impermanent, O
friend.

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
“But that which is impermanent, is that suffering or happiness?
Suffering, O friend.”

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
“But that which is impermanent, suffering, and liable to change, is that
proper to recognize [as] “This is mine, this I am, this is
myself?” Certainly not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
Therefore, O friend Yamaka, whichever form, whether of the past, future or
present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, that
which is far or near, all forms, this should be seen with right wisdom as it
has come to be thus: “Not this is mine, not this I am, not this is
myself.” Whichever feeling, whether of the past, future or present,
internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, that which is
far or near, all feelings, this should be seen with right wisdom as it has
come to be thus: “Not this is mine, not this I am, not this is
myself.” Whichever perception, whether of the past, future or
present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, that
which is far or near, all perceptions, this should be seen with right wisdom
as it has come to be thus: “Not this is mine, not this I am, not this is
myself.” Whichever sankharas, whether of the past, future or
present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, that
which is far or near, all sankharas, these should be seen with right wisdom
as it has come to be thus: “Not this is mine, not this I am, not this is
myself.” Whichever consciousness, whether of the past, future or
present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, that
which is far or near, all consciousnesses, this should be seen with right
wisdom as it has come to be thus: “Not this is mine, not this I am, not
this is myself.”

<p><span class="parno">27</span>
Seeing thus, O friend Yamaka, the one to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma]
comes to be, the noble disciple, becomes alienated in form, in feelings too
he becomes alienated, in perception too he becomes alienated, in sankharas
too he becomes alienated, also alienated in consciousness too he becomes
alienated. Alienation fades away. From fading away, it liberates. In
liberation, there is the knowledge: “It is liberated.”. He
wisely understands: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of purity,
done is what had to be done, there is no other for thusness.”

<p><span class="parno">28</span>
“So what do you think, O friend Yamaka? Do you recognize the Tathagata as
form?” Certainly not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
“Do you recognize the Tathagata as feeling?” Certainly not, O
friend.

<p><span class="parno">30</span>
“Do you recognize the Tathagata as perception?” Certainly not, O
friend.

<p><span class="parno">31</span>
“Do you recognize the Tathagata as sankharas?” Certainly not, O
friend.

<p><span class="parno">32</span>
“Do you recognize the Tathagata as consciousness?” Certainly
not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">33</span>
“So what do you think, O friend Yamaka? Do you recognize the Tathagata as
in form?” Certainly not, O friend. Do you recognize the Tathagata
as apart from form?” Certainly not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">34</span>
“Do you recognize the Tathagata as in feeling?” Certainly not, O
friend. Do you recognize the Tathagata as apart from feeling?”
Certainly not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">35</span>
“Do you recognize the Tathagata as in perception?” Certainly
not, O friend. Do you recognize the Tathagata as apart from
perception?” Certainly not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">36</span>
“Do you recognize the Tathagata as in sankharas?” Certainly not,
O friend. Do you recognize the Tathagata as apart from sankharas?”
Certainly not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">37</span>
“Do you recognize the Tathagata as in consciousness?” Certainly
not, O friend. Do you recognize the Tathagata as apart from
consciousness?” Certainly not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">38</span>
“So what do you think, O friend Yamaka? Do you recognize the Tathagata as
form, feeling, perception, sankharas, and consciousness?” Certainly
not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">39</span>
“So what do you think, O friend Yamaka? Do you recognize the Tathagata as
without form, without feeling, without perception, without sankharas, and
without consciousness?” Certainly not, O friend.

<p><span class="parno">40</span>
But here, O friend Yamaka, [given that] from truth and fact, the Tathagata
is not being affirmed by you even in this very life, is it proper for you to
declare thus: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Auspicious One,
from the breakup of the body, a bhikkhu with asavas destroyed becomes
annihilated and destroyed and does not exist after death?”
“Formerly, O friend Sariputta, as a fool, that evil entrenchment in view
came to be for me. But now, having heard this Dhamma exposition of the
venerable Sariputta, for me that evil entrenchment in view has been
abandoned, and the breakthrough to the Dhamma has been made by me.”

<p><span class="parno">41</span>
Then if, O friend Yamaka, they were to ask you thus: “That bhikkhu, O
friend Yamaka, who is an arahant with asavas destroyed, with the breakup of
the body, after death, what does he come to be? [If] you were asked thus, O
friend Yamaka, how precisely will you answer?”

<p><span class="parno">42</span>
If, O friend, they were to ask me thus: “That bhikkhu, O friend Yamaka,
who is an arahant with asavas destroyed, with the breakup of the body, after
death, what does he come to be? Thus asked, O friend, I would answer thus:
Form, O friend, is impermanent, that which is impermanent is suffering. That
which is suffering has ceased, that has disappeared. Feeling is impermanent,
that which is impermanent is suffering. That which is suffering has ceased,
that has disappeared. Perception is impermanent, that which is impermanent
is suffering. That which is suffering has ceased, that has
disappeared. Sankharas are impermanent, that which is impermanent is
suffering. That which is suffering has ceased, that has
disappeared. Consciousness is impermanent, that which is impermanent is
suffering. That which is suffering has ceased, that has disappeared. Thus
asked, O friend, I would answer thus.

<p><span class="parno">43</span>
Good good, friend Yamaka. If that is so, O friend Yamaka, I will make a
simile for you for this meaning to be understood even more.

<p><span class="parno">44</span>
Just as, O friend Yamaka, a head of household or head of household's son,
wealthy, having great riches, one endowed with great wealth and protection,
just for him some man might arise, one who wishes his harm, one who wishes
his ruin, one who wishes for his danger, one who wishes to deprive him of
life. It occurs to him thus: “This head of household or head of
household's son is wealthy, having great riches, one endowed with great
wealth and protection. To forcibly deprive him of life cannot be easily
done. What if, having intruded [unsuspectedly], I might deprive him of
life?”. Having approached that head of household or head of
household's son, he might say thus: “I would attend on you,
sir.”. Then he would attend on this head of household or head of
household's son. As an attendant, he would wait on him, getting up before
him, retiring after him, obedient in his service, pleasing in his conduct,
endearing in his speech.

<p><span class="parno">45</span>
For him the head of household or head of household's son would have faith,
even befriend him. From friendship too he would truly accept and would
undertake trust in him. When, O friend, it occurs to the man thus:
“Dismiss this head of household or head of household's son of mine
altogether.” Then having found out he has gone to a lonely place,
he would deprive him of life with a sharp knife.

<p><span class="parno">46</span>
So what do you think, O friend Yamaka? When that man, having approached the
head of household or head of household's son, had said thus: “I would
attend on you, sir,” even then he was just a murderer, and yet did
he not understand the murderer to be: “my murderer?” Also when
he would wait on him, getting up before him, retiring after him, obedient in
his service, pleasing in his conduct, endearing in his speech, even then he
was just a murderer, and yet did he not understand the murderer to be:
“my murderer?” Also when, for him having found out he has gone
to lonely place, he deprived him of life with a sharp knife, even then he
was just a murderer, and yet did he not understand the murderer to be:
“my murderer?” “Yes, friend.”

<p><span class="parno">47</span>
It is just so, O friend, the one to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] does
not come to be, the puthujjana; the one who does not possess the vision of
the noble ones, not well-versed, not trained in the noble ones’ Dhamma; the
one who does not possess the vision of the true men, not well-versed, not
trained in the true men’s Dhamma, recognizes form as self, or self as
endowed with form, or form as in self, or self as in form.

<p><span class="parno">48</span>
He recognizes feeling as self, or self as endowed with feeling, or feeling
as in self, or self as in feeling.

<p><span class="parno">49</span>
He recognizes perception as self, or self as endowed with perception, or
perception as in self, or self as in perception.

<p><span class="parno">50</span>
He recognizes sankharas as self, or self as endowed with sankharas, or
sankharas as in self, or self as in sankharas.

<p><span class="parno">51</span>
He recognizes consciousness as self, or self as endowed with consciousness,
or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">52</span>
He does not wisely understand as it has come to be, impermanent form as
impermanent form, impermanent feeling as impermanent feeling, impermanent
perception as impermanent perception, impermanent sankharas as impermanent
sankharas, impermanent consciousness as impermanent consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">53</span>
He does not wisely understand as it has come to be, suffering form as
suffering form, suffering feeling as suffering feeling, suffering perception
as suffering perception, suffering sankharas as suffering sankharas,
suffering consciousness as suffering consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">54</span>
He does not wisely understand as it has come to be, selfless form as
selfless form, selfless feeling as selfless feeling, selfless perception as
selfless perception, selfless sankharas as selfless sankharas, selfless
consciousness as selfless consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">55</span>
He does not wisely understand as it has come to be, conditioned form as
conditioned form, conditioned feeling as conditioned feeling, conditioned
perception as conditioned perception, conditioned sankharas as conditioned
sankharas, conditioned consciousness as conditioned consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">56</span>
He does not wisely understand as it has come to be, murderous form as
murderous form, murderous feeling as murderous feeling, murderous perception
as murderous perception, murderous sankharas as murderous sankharas,
murderous consciousness as murderous consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">57</span>
He becomes engaged in form, appropriates it, takes a stand upon it as:
“myself.” He becomes engaged in feeling, appropriates it, takes
a stand upon it as: “myself.” He becomes engaged in perception,
appropriates it, takes a stand upon it as: “myself.” He becomes
engaged in sankharas, appropriates them, takes a stand upon them as:
“myself.” He becomes engaged in consciousness, appropriates it,
takes a stand upon it as: “myself.” These five stocks of
appropriation, of which he becomes engaged in and appropriates, lead to his
harm and suffering for a long time.

<p><span class="parno">58</span>
But, O friend, the one to whom the hearing [of the Dhamma] comes to be, the
noble disciple; the one who possesses the vision of the noble ones,
well-versed, trained in the noble ones’ Dhamma; the one who possesses the
vision of the true men, well-versed, trained in the true men’s Dhamma, does
not recognize form as self, or self as endowed with form, or form as in
self, or self as in form.

<p><span class="parno">59</span>
He does not recognize feeling as self, or self as endowed with feeling, or
feeling as in self, or self as in feeling.

<p><span class="parno">60</span>
He does not recognize perception as self, or self as endowed with
perception, or perception as in self, or self as in perception.

<p><span class="parno">61</span>
He does not recognize sankharas as self, or self as endowed with sankharas,
or sankharas as in self, or self as in sankharas.

<p><span class="parno">62</span>
He does not recognize consciousness as self, or self as endowed with
consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">62</span>
 He wisely understands as it has come to be, impermanent form as impermanent
form, impermanent feeling as impermanent feeling, impermanent perception as
impermanent perception, impermanent sankharas as impermanent sankharas,
impermanent consciousness as impermanent consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">63</span>
He wisely understands as it has come to be, suffering form as suffering
form, suffering feeling as suffering feeling, suffering perception as
suffering perception, suffering sankharas as suffering sankharas, suffering
consciousness as suffering consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">64</span>
He wisely understands as it has come to be, selfless form as selfless form,
selfless feeling as selfless feeling, selfless perception as selfless
perception, selfless sankharas as selfless sankharas, selfless consciousness
as selfless consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">65</span>
He wisely understands as it has come to be, conditioned form as conditioned
form, conditioned feeling as conditioned feeling, conditioned perception as
conditioned perception, conditioned sankharas as conditioned sankharas,
conditioned consciousness as conditioned consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">66</span>
He wisely understands as it has come to be, murderous form as murderous
form, murderous feeling as murderous feeling, murderous perception as
murderous perception, murderous sankharas as murderous sankharas, murderous
consciousness as murderous consciousness.

<p><span class="parno">67</span>
He does not become engaged in form, appropriate it, take a stand upon it as:
“myself.” He does not become engaged in feeling, appropriate it,
take a stand upon it as: “myself.” He does not become engaged in
perception, appropriate it, take a stand upon it as: “myself.”
He does not become engaged in sankharas, appropriate them, take a stand upon
them as: “myself.” He does not become engaged in consciousness,
appropriate it, take a stand upon it as: “myself.” These five
stocks of appropriation, of which he does not become engaged in and
appropriate, lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time.

<p><span class="parno">68</span>
“Just this comes to be, O friend Sariputta, for those venerables who
[have] such compassionate ones, well wishers, advisers, instructors as
companions in the life of purity. And now having heard this Dhamma
exposition of the venerable Sariputta, my mind is liberated from the asavas
without appropriations.”

<p><span class="parno">69</span>
This is what the venerable Sariputta said. Delighted, the venerable Yamaka
