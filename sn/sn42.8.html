At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling in Nalanda at the Pavarika Mango
Grove. Then Asibandhakaputta, the village chief, visited with the Auspicious
One. Upon arrival, having bowed down to the Auspicious One, he sat down to
one side. Having sat down to one side, the Auspicious One said this to
Asibandhakaputta, the village chief: “How, O village chief, does Nigantha
Nataputta teach the Dhamma to his disciples?”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“Nigantha Nataputta, O Bhante, teaches the dhamma to his disciples thus:
“Anyone at all who causes to kill living beings, belongs to the state of
misery, doomed to suffer in hell. Anyone at all who takes what is not given,
belongs to the state of misery, doomed to suffer in hell. Anyone at all who
misconducts in sensual pleasures, belongs to the state of misery, doomed to
suffer in hell. Anyone at all who tells lies, belongs to the state of
misery, doomed to suffer in hell. In which ever way one frequently dwells,
in just that way one is led along”. It is in this way, O Bhante,
that Nigantha Nataputta teaches the dhamma to his disciples.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“In which ever way one frequently dwells, in just that way one is led
along”, O village chief, that being so, no one will belong to the
state of misery, no one will be doomed to suffer in hell according to
Nigantha Nataputta's words. “So what do you think, O village chief?
Whichever person undertakes the killing of living beings, whether by night
or by day on any given occasion, what is more? The occasions when he kills
living beings or the occasions when he does not kill living
beings?”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
“Whichever person, O Bhante, undertakes the killing of living beings,
whether by night or by day on any given occasion, less are the occasions
when he kills living beings. Certainly more are the occasions when he does
not kill living beings.” “In which ever way one frequently
dwells, in just that way one is led along”, O village chief, that
being so, no one will belong to the state of misery, no one will be doomed
to suffer in hell according to Nigantha Nataputta's words.

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“So what do you think, O village chief? Whichever person undertakes the
taking of what is not given, whether by night or by day on any given
occasion, what is more? The occasions when he takes what is not given or the
occasions when he does not take what is not given?” “Whichever
person, O Bhante, undertakes the taking of what is not given, whether by
night or by day on any given occasion, less are the occasions when he takes
what is not given. Certainly more are the occasions when he does not take
what is not given.” “In which ever way one frequently dwells, in
just that way one is led along”, O village chief, that being so, no
one will belong to the state of misery, no one will be doomed to suffer in
hell according to Nigantha Nataputta's words.

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
“So what do you think, O village chief? Whichever person undertakes
misconduct in sensual pleasures, whether by night or by day on any given
occasion, what is more? The occasions when he misconducts in sensual
pleasures or the occasions when he does not misconduct in sensual
pleasures?” “Whichever person, O Bhante, undertakes misconduct
in sensual pleasures, whether by night or by day on any given occasion, less
are the occasions when he misconducts in sensual pleasures. Certainly more
are the occasions when he does not misconduct in sensual
pleasures.” “In which ever way one frequently dwells, in just
that way one is led along”, O village chief, that being so, no one
will belong to the state of misery, no one will be doomed to suffer in hell
according to Nigantha Nataputta's words.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
“So what do you think, O village chief? Whichever person undertakes the
telling of lies, whether by night or by day on any given occasion, what is
more? The occasions when he tells lies or the occasions when he does not
tell lies?” “Whichever person, O Bhante, undertakes the telling
of lies, whether by night or by day on any given occasion, less are the
occasions when he tells lies. Certainly more are the occasions when he does
not tell lies.” “In which ever way one frequently dwells, in
just that way one is led along”, O village chief, that being so, no
one will belong to the state of misery, no one will be doomed to suffer in
hell according to Nigantha Nataputta's words.

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Here, O village chief, a certain Teacher is of such doctrine, of such view:
“Anyone at all who causes to kill living beings, belongs to the state of
misery, doomed to suffer in hell. Anyone at all who takes what is not given,
belongs to the state of misery, doomed to suffer in hell. Anyone at all who
misconducts in sensual pleasures, belongs to the state of misery, doomed to
suffer in hell. Anyone at all who tells lies, belongs to the state of
misery, doomed to suffer in hell.” Now, O village chief, it occurs
to the Teacher's disciple who places high faith [in him] thus: My Teacher is
of such doctrine, of such view: “Anyone at all who causes to kill living
beings, belongs to the state of misery, doomed to suffer in hell. Anyone at
all who takes what is not given, belongs to the state of misery, doomed to
suffer in hell. Anyone at all who misconducts in sensual pleasures, belongs
to the state of misery, doomed to suffer in hell. Anyone at all who tells
lies, belongs to the state of misery, doomed to suffer in hell.”
But there is the killing of living beings [done] by me. He acquires the
view: I too belong to the state of misery, doomed to suffer in hell. Without
having abandoned that assertion, O village chief, without having abandoned
that state of mind, without having relinquished that view, he will be put
down in hell accordingly as if carried [there].

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
My Teacher is of such doctrine, is of such view thus: “Anyone at all who
takes what is not given, belongs to the state of misery, doomed to suffer in
hell.” But there is the taking of what is not given [done] by
me. He acquires the view: I too belong to the state of misery, doomed to
suffer in hell. Without having abandoned that assertion, O village chief,
without having abandoned that state of mind, without having relinquished
that view, he will be put down in hell accordingly as if carried [there].

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
My Teacher is of such doctrine, is of such view thus: “Anyone at all who
misconducts in sensual pleasures, belongs to the state of misery, doomed to
suffer in hell.” But there is misconduct in sensual pleasures
[done] by me. He acquires the view: I too belong to the state of misery,
doomed to suffer in hell. Without having abandoned that assertion, O village
chief, without having abandoned that state of mind, without having
relinquished that view, he will be put down in hell accordingly as if
carried [there].

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
My Teacher is of such doctrine, is of such view thus: “Anyone at all who
tells lies, belongs to the state of misery, doomed to suffer in
hell.” But there is false [speech] spoken by me. He acquires the
view: I too belong to the state of misery, doomed to suffer in hell. Without
having abandoned that assertion, O village chief, without having abandoned
that state of mind, without having relinquished that view, he will be put
down in hell accordingly as if carried [there].

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
But here, O village chief, a Tathagata arises in the world, the Arahant,
rightly self-awakened, excelling in knowledge and conduct, well-farer,
knower of the worlds, incomparable charioteer of tamed persons, teacher of
devas and humans, awakened, auspicious. He in many teachings reproaches and
censures the killing of living beings and says: “You must all abstain
from the killing of living beings.” He reproaches and censures the
taking of what is not given and says: “You must all abstain from the
taking of what is not given.” He reproaches and censures misconduct
in sensual pleasures and says: “You must all abstain from misconduct in
sensual pleasures.” He reproaches and censures false speech and
says: “You must all abstain from false speech.”

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
But here, O village chief, the Teacher's disciple [possessed of] the higher
faith reflects thus: “The Auspicious One in many teachings reproaches and
censures the killing of living beings and says: “You must all abstain
from the killing of living beings.” But there is the killing of
living beings [done] by me to this or that extent. But to whatever extend
the killing of living beings [have been done] by me, that is not proper,
that is not good. And yet even were I to be remorseful, that evil kamma of
mine will not be undone.” Having reflected thus, he simply abandons
the killing of living beings and abstains from the killing of living beings
in the future. Thus, is the abandoning of that evil kamma, thus is the
surmounting of that evil kamma.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
“The Auspicious One in many teachings reproaches and censures the taking
of what is not given and says: “You must all abstain from the taking of
what is not given.” But there is the taking of what is not given
[done] by me to this or that extent. But to whatever extend the taking of
what is not given [has been done] by me, that is not proper, that is not
good. And yet even were I to be remorseful, that evil kamma of mine will not
be undone.” Having reflected thus, he simply abandons the taking of
what is not given and abstains from the taking of what is not given in the
future. Thus, is the abandoning of that evil kamma, thus is the surmounting
of that evil kamma.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
“The Auspicious One in many teachings reproaches and censures misconduct
in sensual pleasures and says: “You must all abstain from misconduct in
sensual pleasures.” But there is misconduct in sensual pleasures
[done] by me to this or that extent. But to whatever extend misconduct in
sensual pleasures [have been done] by me, that is not proper, that is not
good. And yet even were I to be remorseful, that evil kamma of mine will not
be undone.” Having reflected thus, he simply abandons misconduct in
sensual pleasures and abstains from misconduct in sensual pleasures in the
future. Thus, is the abandoning of that evil kamma, thus is the surmounting
of that evil kamma.

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
“The Auspicious One in many teachings reproaches and censures false
speech and says: “You must all abstain from false speech.” But
there is false [speech] spoken by me to this or that extent. But to whatever
extend false [speech] has been spoken by me, that is not proper, that is not
good. And yet even were I to be remorseful, that evil kamma of mine will not
be undone.” Having reflected thus, he simply abandons false speech
and abstains from false speech in the future. Thus, is the abandoning of
that evil kamma, thus is the surmounting of that evil kamma.

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
Having abandoned the killing of living beings, he abstains from the killing
of living beings. Having abandoned the taking of what is not given, he
abstains from the taking of what is not given. Having abandoned misconduct
in sensual pleasures, he abstains from misconduct in sensual
pleasures. Having abandoned false speech, he abstains from false
speech. Having abandoned divisive speech, he abstains from divisive
speech. Having abandoned harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech. Having
abandoned senseless prattle, he abstains from senseless prattle. Having
abandoned covetousness, he is not covetous. Having abandoned ill-will and
hatred, he is one of a benevolent mind. Having abandoned wrong view, he is
one of right view.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
The noble disciple, O village chief, thus rid of covetousness, rid of
ill-will, unconfused, mindful and clearly comprehending, with a mind imbued
with metta, dwells pervading one direction, likewise the second direction,
likewise the third direction, likewise the fourth direction, above, below,
around, to all beings in the entire world he dwells pervading with a mind
imbued with metta, abundant, grown great, boundless, and free from enmity
and ill-will. Just as, O village chief, a powerful conch shell blower would
easily, without difficulty, convey [the sound of his conch shell] in the
four directions, just so, O village chief, with the liberation of mind by
metta thus matured, thus made abundant, any measureable kamma done will not
remain there, will not persist there.

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
The noble disciple, O village chief, thus rid of covetousness, rid of
ill-will, unconfused, mindful and clearly comprehending, with a mind imbued

around, to all beings in the entire world he dwells pervading with a mind

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
The noble disciple, O village chief, thus rid of covetousness, rid of
ill-will, unconfused, mindful and clearly comprehending, with a mind imbued
with mudita, dwells pervading one direction, likewise the second direction,
likewise the third direction, likewise the fourth direction, above, below,
around, to all beings in the entire world he dwells pervading with a mind
imbued with mudita, abundant, grown great, boundless, and free from enmity
and ill-will. Just as, O village chief, a powerful conch shell blower would
easily, without difficulty, convey [the sound of his conch shell] in the

mudita thus matured, thus made abundant, any measureable kamma done will not

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
The noble disciple, O village chief, thus rid of covetousness, rid of
ill-will, unconfused, mindful and clearly comprehending, with a mind imbued
with upekha, dwells pervading one direction, likewise the second direction,
likewise the third direction, likewise the fourth direction, above, below,
around, to all beings in the entire world he dwells pervading with a mind
imbued with upekha, abundant, grown great, boundless, and free from enmity
and ill-will. Just as, O village chief, a powerful conch shell blower would
easily, without difficulty, convey [the sound of his conch shell] in the
four directions, just so, O village chief, with the liberation of mind by
upekha thus matured, thus made abundant, any measureable kamma done will not
remain there, will not persist there.

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
When thus was said, Asibandhakaputta, the village chief, said this to the
Auspicious One: “Excellent, O Bhante! Excellent, O Bhante! Just as, O
Bhante, one might set upright what has been overturned, or open up what has
been closed, or show a path to one who is lost, or bear an oil lamp in the
darkness so that those with good eyesight can see forms.” Just so
has the Dhamma been explained by the venerable Gotama in countless ways. I
go, O Bhante, to the Auspicious One as refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the
Sangha of bhikkhus. May the Auspicious One bear it in mind, that I am a lay
disciple who has gone for refuge from today for as long as life lasts.
