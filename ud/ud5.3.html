<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me: At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding Place. At that time
in Rajagaha, there was a leper named Suppabuddha, a poor man, a wretched
man, a miserable man.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
At that time the Auspicious One was seated teaching the Dhamma, surrounded
by a large assembly. The leper Suppabuddha saw from afar that a great
multitude of people have assembled. Having seen this, it occured to him:
“undoubtedly, here some hard food or soft food will be distributed. What
if, I stop by that great multitude of people. It is well if some of this
hard food or soft food might be obtained [by me].”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
So then, the leper Suppabuddha stopped by that great multitude of
people. The leper Suppabuddha saw the Auspicious One seated teaching the
Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. Having seen this, it occured to him:
“Here there is really not any hard food or soft food being
distributed. It is this samana Gotama teaching the Dhamma to an
assembly. What if I, too would listen to the Dhamma?” Just there he
sat down to one side [thinking]: “I too will hear the Dhamma.”
Then the Auspicious One applied his mind and encompassed fully the whole of
that assembly with his mind, thinking: “Who here is able to understand
the Dhamma?”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
The Auspicious One saw the leper Suppabuddha seated in that assembly. Having
seen this, it occured to him: “In fact this one here is able to
understand the Dhamma.” Having regard for the leper Suppabuddha, he
taught a graduated discourse. That is, talk on generosity, talk on virtue,
talk on heaven, explaining the danger, degradation and defilements of sense
desires, and the advantages of renunciation. When the Auspicious One knew
that the leper Suppabuddha's mind was ready, pliable, free from the
hindrances, joyful, confident, he revealed in brief the teaching on Dhamma
unique to the Buddhas: suffering, origination, cessation, path. And just as
a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed, receives the dye
perfectly, just so for the leper Suppabuddha, as he sat there, there arose
the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye: “Whatever is liable to origination, all
that is liable to cessation.”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Then the leper Suppabuddha, having seen the Dhamma, reached the Dhamma,
known the Dhamma, plunged into the Dhamma, having crossed over doubt, being
without uncertainty, having attained self-confidence, became independent of
others in the Teacher's instructions. Having risen up from his seat, went to
the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, he bowed down to the Auspicious One and
sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the leper Suppabuddha
said this to the Auspicious One: “Excellent, O Bhante! Excellent, O
Bhante! Just as, O Bhante, one might set upright what has been overturned,
or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost, or bear
an oil lamp in the darkness so that those with good eyesight can see forms,
just so has the Dhamma been explained by the Auspicious One in countless
ways. I go, O Bhante, to the Auspicious One as refuge, and to the Dhamma,
and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. May the Auspicious One bear it in mind, that
I am a lay disciple who has gone for refuge from today, for as long as life
lasts.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Then the Auspicious One instructed, aroused, energized, gladdened the leper
Suppabuddha with a Dhamma talk. Having delighted, having rejoiced in the
Auspicious One's words, having risen up from his seat, having bowed down,
having circumambulated the Auspicious One, he departed.

Then, soon after departing, a cow with a young calf, having knocked down the
leper Suppabuddha, deprived him of life.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Then many bhikkhus went to the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, they bowed down
to the Auspicious One and sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side,
those bhikkhus said this to the Auspicious One: “O Bhante, the leper
named Suppabuddha, whom the Auspicious One instructed, aroused, energized,
gladdened with a Dhamma talk, has passed away. What is his destiny? What is
his after-death state?”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
“A wise one, O bhikkhus, was the leper Suppabuddha. He brought into being
the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, and did not trouble me on account
of the Dhamma. The leper Suppabuddha, O bhikkhus, from the complete
destruction of the three fetters, is a sotapanna, not subject to the woeful
plane, on a fixed course, destined for supreme awakening.”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
When thus was said, a certain bhikkhu said this to the Auspicious One:
“What is the cause, O Bhante, what is the condition by which the leper
Suppabuddha came to be a poor man, a wretched man, a miserable
man?”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
“Formally, O bhikkhus, the leper Suppabuddha was the son of a millionaire
in this very Rajagaha. While he was going out to his pleasure park, he saw
Paccekabuddha Tagarasikhi entering the town for alms food. Having seen this,
it occured to him: “Just who indeed is this leper wandering with his
leper robe?” Having spat out, having gone around keeping his left
side towards [Paccekabuddha Tagarasikhi as a token of disrespect] he
departed. As a result of that kamma, he roasted in hell for many years, for
many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of
thousands of years. For just the remaining results of that kamma, he became
a leper in this very Rajagaha, a poor man, a wretched man, a miserable
man. Having come to the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata,
he undertook faith, undertook virtue, undertook learning, undertook
generosity, undertook wisdom. Having come to the Dhamma and discipline
proclaimed by the Tathagata, having undertaken faith, having undertaken
virtue, having undertaken learning, having undertaken generosity, having
undertaken wisdom, with the breakup of the body, after death, he has
re-arisen in a happy destination, a heavenly world, in companionship with
the devas of Tavatimsa. There he clearly outshines the other devas with
beauty and with glory.”

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of this, uttered
this inspired utterance:

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “As one endowed with eyes,<br> simply endeavors to avoid uneven [paths],<br>
a wise one in the world of living beings,<br> avoids the evil deeds.”

leper Suppabuddha, deprived him of life.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Then many bhikkhus went to the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, they bowed down
to the Auspicious One and sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side,
those bhikkhus said this to the Auspicious One: “O Bhante, the leper
named Suppabuddha, whom the Auspicious One instructed, aroused, energized,
gladdened with a Dhamma talk, has passed away. What is his destiny? What is
his after-death state?”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
“A wise one, O bhikkhus, was the leper Suppabuddha. He brought into being
the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, and did not trouble me on account
of the Dhamma. The leper Suppabuddha, O bhikkhus, from the complete
destruction of the three fetters, is a sotapanna, not subject to the woeful
plane, on a fixed course, destined for supreme awakening.”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
When thus was said, a certain bhikkhu said this to the Auspicious One:
“What is the cause, O Bhante, what is the condition by which the leper
Suppabuddha came to be a poor man, a wretched man, a miserable
man?”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
“Formally, O bhikkhus, the leper Suppabuddha was the son of a millionaire
in this very Rajagaha. While he was going out to his pleasure park, he saw
Paccekabuddha Tagarasikhi entering the town for alms food. Having seen this,
it occured to him: “Just who indeed is this leper wandering with his
leper robe?” Having spat out, having gone around keeping his left
side towards [Paccekabuddha Tagarasikhi as a token of disrespect] he
departed. As a result of that kamma, he roasted in hell for many years, for
many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of
thousands of years. For just the remaining results of that kamma, he became
a leper in this very Rajagaha, a poor man, a wretched man, a miserable
man. Having come to the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata,
he undertook faith, undertook virtue, undertook learning, undertook
generosity, undertook wisdom. Having come to the Dhamma and discipline
proclaimed by the Tathagata, having undertaken faith, having undertaken
virtue, having undertaken learning, having undertaken generosity, having
undertaken wisdom, with the breakup of the body, after death, he has
re-arisen in a happy destination, a heavenly world, in companionship with
the devas of Tavatimsa. There he clearly outshines the other devas with
beauty and with glory.”

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of this, uttered
this inspired utterance:

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “As one endowed with eyes,<br> simply endeavors to avoid uneven [paths],<br>
a wise one in the world of living beings,<br> avoids the evil deeds.”

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me: At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding Place. At that time
in Rajagaha, there was a leper named Suppabuddha, a poor man, a wretched
man, a miserable man.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
At that time the Auspicious One was seated teaching the Dhamma, surrounded
by a large assembly. The leper Suppabuddha saw from afar that a great
multitude of people have assembled. Having seen this, it occured to him:
“undoubtedly, here some hard food or soft food will be distributed. What
if, I stop by that great multitude of people. It is well if some of this
hard food or soft food might be obtained [by me].”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
So then, the leper Suppabuddha stopped by that great multitude of
people. The leper Suppabuddha saw the Auspicious One seated teaching the
Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. Having seen this, it occured to him:
“Here there is really not any hard food or soft food being
distributed. It is this samana Gotama teaching the Dhamma to an
assembly. What if I, too would listen to the Dhamma?” Just there he
sat down to one side [thinking]: “I too will hear the Dhamma.”
Then the Auspicious One applied his mind and encompassed fully the whole of
that assembly with his mind, thinking: “Who here is able to understand
the Dhamma?”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
The Auspicious One saw the leper Suppabuddha seated in that assembly. Having
seen this, it occured to him: “In fact this one here is able to
understand the Dhamma.” Having regard for the leper Suppabuddha, he
taught a graduated discourse. That is, talk on generosity, talk on virtue,
talk on heaven, explaining the danger, degradation and defilements of sense
desires, and the advantages of renunciation. When the Auspicious One knew
that the leper Suppabuddha's mind was ready, pliable, free from the
hindrances, joyful, confident, he revealed in brief the teaching on Dhamma
unique to the Buddhas: suffering, origination, cessation, path. And just as
a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed, receives the dye
perfectly, just so for the leper Suppabuddha, as he sat there, there arose
the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye: “Whatever is liable to origination, all
that is liable to cessation.”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Then the leper Suppabuddha, having seen the Dhamma, reached the Dhamma,
known the Dhamma, plunged into the Dhamma, having crossed over doubt, being
without uncertainty, having attained self-confidence, became independent of
others in the Teacher's dispensation. Having risen up from his seat, went to
the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, he bowed down to the Auspicious One and
sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, the leper Suppabuddha
said this to the Auspicious One: “Excellent, O Bhante! Excellent, O
Bhante! Just as, O Bhante, one might set upright what has been overturned,
or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost, or bear
an oil lamp in the darkness so that those with good eyesight can see forms,
just so has the Dhamma been explained by the Auspicious One in countless
ways. I go, O Bhante, to the Auspicious One as refuge, and to the Dhamma,
and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. May the Auspicious One bear it in mind, that
I am a lay disciple who has gone for refuge from today, for as long as life
lasts.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Then the Auspicious One instructed, aroused, energized, gladdened the leper
Suppabuddha with a Dhamma talk. Having delighted, having rejoiced in the
Auspicious One's words, having risen up from his seat, having bowed down,
having circumambulated the Auspicious One, he departed.

Then, soon after departing, a cow with a young calf, having knocked down the
leper Suppabuddha, deprived him of life.

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Then many bhikkhus went to the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, they bowed down
to the Auspicious One and sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side,
those bhikkhus said this to the Auspicious One: “O Bhante, the leper
named Suppabuddha, whom the Auspicious One instructed, aroused, energized,
gladdened with a Dhamma talk, has passed away. What is his destiny? What is
his after-death state?”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
“A wise one, O bhikkhus, was the leper Suppabuddha. He brought into being
the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, and did not trouble me on account
of the Dhamma. The leper Suppabuddha, O bhikkhus, from the complete
destruction of the three fetters, is a sotapanna, not subject to the woeful
plane, on a fixed course, destined for supreme awakening.”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
When thus was said, a certain bhikkhu said this to the Auspicious One:
“What is the cause, O Bhante, what is the condition by which the leper
Suppabuddha came to be a poor man, a wretched man, a miserable
man?”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
“Formally, O bhikkhus, the leper Suppabuddha was the son of a millionaire
in this very Rajagaha. While he was going out to his pleasure park, he saw
Paccekabuddha Tagarasikhi entering the town for alms food. Having seen this,
it occured to him: “Just who indeed is this leper wandering with his
leper robe?” Having spat out, having gone around keeping his left
side towards [Paccekabuddha Tagarasikhi as a token of disrespect] he
departed. As a result of that kamma, he roasted in hell for many years, for
many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of
thousands of years. For just the remaining results of that kamma, he became
a leper in this very Rajagaha, a poor man, a wretched man, a miserable
man. Having come to the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata,
he undertook faith, undertook virtue, undertook learning, undertook
generosity, undertook wisdom. Having come to the Dhamma and discipline
proclaimed by the Tathagata, having undertaken faith, having undertaken
virtue, having undertaken learning, having undertaken generosity, having
undertaken wisdom, with the breakup of the body, after death, he has
re-arisen in a happy destination, a heavenly world, in companionship with
the devas of Tavatimsa. There he simply outshines the other devas with
beauty and with glory.”

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of this, uttered
this inspired utterance:

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “As one endowed with eyes,<br> simply endeavors to avoid uneven [paths],<br>
a wise one in the world of living beings,<br> avoids the evil deeds.”
