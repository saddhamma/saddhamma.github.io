<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling in
Savatthi at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
At that time, Bahiya Daruciriya, was dwelling at the sea shore in
Supparaka. He was honoured, respected, revered, venerated, worshipped. He
was a gainer of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines, provisions and
necessities for the sick. It so happened that while Bahiya Daruciriya had
gone to a lonely place and was in seclusion, a reflection arose in his mind
thus: “But whoever in the world is an arahant or have entered upon the
path to arahantship, am I a certain one among them?”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
So then, a deva who was a former blood relative of Bahiya Daruciriya, having
known by his mind the reflection in Bahiya Baruciriya's mind, visited with
Bahiya Daruciriya, out of compassion, wishing for his benefit. Upon arrival,
he said this to Bahiya Daruciriya: “You, O Bahiya, are certainly not an
arahant. You have not even entered upon the path to arahantship. Even those
practices of yours are not that by which you might become an arahant or
enter upon the path to arahantship.” “So who now in the world
including the devas, is an arahant, or has entered upon the path to
arahantship?” “There is, O Bahiya, in the northern country, a
town named Savatthi. In that place, the Auspicious One abides at present. He
is the Arahant, the rightly self-awakened one. He indeed, O Bahiya, is the
Auspicious One, the Arahant, and he only teaches the Dhamma for the sake of
arahantship.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
So then, Bahiya Daruciriya, having been aroused to a sense of urgency by
that deva, set out at that moment from Supparaka. Sojourning [only] one
night at every place, he stopped by Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika
Park. At that time, many bhikkhus were walking up and down in the open
air. Then, Bahiya Daruciriya approached those bhikkhus. Upon arrival, he
said this to those bhikkhus: “Where, O Bhante, is he, the Auspicious One,
the Arahant, the rightly self-awakened one abiding at present? We have a
desire to see that Auspicious One, the Arahant, the rightly self-awakened
one.” “The Auspicious One, O Bahiya, has entered among the
houses for alms food.”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
So then, Bahiya Daruciriya, being in a hurry, having come out of Jeta's
Grove, having entered Savatthi, saw the Auspicious One in Savatthi,
wandering for alms food, graceful, inspiring confidence, with faculties
calmed, of peaceful mind, one attained to the highest taming and
tranquility, a Naga with faculties restrained, tamed and guarded. Having
seen, he went to the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, he bowed down with his
head at the Auspicious One's feet and said this to the Auspicious One: “O
Bhante, may the Auspicious One teach me the Dhamma, may the Well-Farer teach
me the Dhamma, which [will] lead to my welfare and happiness for a long
time.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
When thus was said, the Auspicious One said this to Bahiya Daruciriya:
“It is just not the time, O Bahiya. We have entered among the houses for
alms food.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Also for a second time, Bahiya Daruciriya said this to the Auspicious One:
“But this, O Bhante, is difficult to know, what dangers there are for the
Auspicious One's life, or what dangers there are for my life. May the
Auspicious One teach me the Dhamma, may the Well-Farer teach me the Dhamma,
which [will] lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time.”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Also for a second time, the Auspicious One said this to Bahiya Daruciriya:
“It is just not the time, O Bahiya. We have entered among the houses for
alms food.”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
Also for a third time, Bahiya Daruciriya said this to the Auspicious One:
“But this, O Bhante, is difficult to know, what dangers there are for the
Auspicious One's life, or what dangers there are for my life. May the
Auspicious One teach me the Dhamma, may the Well-Farer teach me the Dhamma,
which [will] lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time.”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Therefore, for you Bahiya, it should be trained thus: “In the seen there
will be merely the seen. In the heard there will be merely the heard. In the
thought there will be merely the thought. In the cognized there will be
merely the cognized.” Thus indeed for you Bahiya, should it be
trained.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
“Since for you Bahiya, in the seen there will be merely the seen, in the
heard there will be merely the heard, in the thought there will be merely
the thought, in the cognized there will be merely the cognized, therefore
you Bahiya, are not that by which. Since you Bahiya, are not that by which,
therefore you Bahiya, are not in that place. Since you Bahiya, are not in
that place, therefore you Bahiya, are neither in this world, nor in the
other world, nor in between both [worlds]. Just this is the end of
suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
Then, having [heard] this brief Dhamma exposition from the Auspicious One,
the mind of Bahiya Daruciriya, at that moment, not having appropriated, was
liberated from the asavas.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
Then, Bahiya Daruciriya, having been admonished with this brief advice from
the Auspicious One, set out.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
Then, soon after departing from the Auspicious One, a cow with a young calf,
having knocked down Bahiya Daruciriya, deprived him of life.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
Then the Auspicious One, having wandered in Savatthi for alms food, after
the meal, when he had gone back after alms gathering, having set out from
the town with many bhikkhus, saw that Bahiya Daruciriya had passed
away. Having seen, he addressed the bhikkhus: “You, O bhikkhus, take the
body of Bahiya Daruciriya. Having put it on to a small bed, having taken it
out, you must burn it, and make a stupa for it. Your companion in the life
of purity, O bhikkhus, has passed away.”

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
“Yes, Bhante.” Those bhikkhus, having replied to the Auspicious
One, having taken the body of Bahiya Daruciriya, having put it on to a small
bed, having taken it out, having burnt it, having made a stupa for it, they
went to the Auspicious One. Upon arrival, they bowed down to the Auspicious
One and sat down to one side.

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
Having sat down to one side, those bhikkhus said this to the Auspicious One:
“Burnt, O Bhante, is Bahiya Daruciriya's body. A stupa has been made for
him. What is his destiny? What is his after-death state?”

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
“A wise one, O bhikkhus, was Bahiya Daruciriya. He brought into being the
Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, and did not trouble me on account of
the Dhamma. Completely extinguished, O bhikkhus, is Bahiya
Daruciriya.”

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of this, uttered
this inspired utterance:

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Where water, earth, fire, and air have no footing,<br> There the stars do
not shine, the sun does not give light,<br> the moon does not glow there,
darkness there is not found.”<br> “And when the sage, the brahmin,
through sagacity, has known [this] for himself,<br> Then from form and
formless, from pleasure and pain, he is freed.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
“This too is the meaning of what was said by the Auspicious One. Thus was
heard by me.”
