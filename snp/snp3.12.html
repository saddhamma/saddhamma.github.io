<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One was dwelling in
Savatthi at the Eastern Monastery, the mansion of Migara's Mother. At that
time the Auspicious One was seated in the open air surrounded by the bhikkhu
Sangha during the Uposatha day, the night of the fifteenth day full
moon. Then the Auspicious One, having surveyed the silent bhikkhu Sangha,
addressed the bhikkhus.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Those wholesome dhammas, O bhikkhus, which are noble and emancipating,
leading to self-awakening, O bhikkhus, what is the reason for you samanas
undertaking those wholesome dhammas which are noble and emancipating,
leading to self-awakening? If you were to be questioned thus, O bhikkhus,
thus should be said: “It is only for the knowledge of those dhammas that
are dualities, as they have come to be.” And what are the dualities
that you must speak of:

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“This is suffering. This is the origin of suffering.” This is
one mode of seeing. “This is the cessation of suffering. This is the path
leading to the cessation of suffering.” This is the second mode of
seeing. Rightly seeing in accordance with such and such duality, O bhikkhus,
for a bhikkhu who dwells ever vigilant, ardent and resolute, of two fruits a
certain fruit is to be expected: “in just this very life final knowledge,
or non-returning [if] there is residue remaining.” This is what the
Auspicious One said. Having said this, the Well-farer, the Teacher, further
said this:

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   727. “Those who do not wisely understand suffering, <br> and suffering's
origin;<br> and where all sufferings, <br> are cut off without remainder;<br> they
do not wisely understand that path ,<br> leading to suffering's appeasement.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   728. With inferior mind liberation,<br> and wisdom liberation;<br> they are
incapable of making an end,<br> they surely go to birth and old age.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   729. But those who wisely understand suffering, <br> and suffering's origin;<br>
and where all sufferings, <br> are cut off without remainder;<br> they wisely
understand that path ,<br> leading to suffering's appeasement.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   730. Endowed with mind liberation,<br> and wisdom liberation;<br> they are
capable of making an end to the path,<br> they do not go to birth and old
age.”
</p>


<p><span class="parno">15</span>
If, O bhikkhus, you are questioned further thus: Might there also be another
method by which [there is] right seeing in accordance with a duality? There
might be, should be said. And how might there be? O bhikkhus, of the deva,
māra and brahma worlds, together with the population of samanas and
brahmanas, devas and humans, that which is looked upon as: “This is the
truth,” that the noble ones have well seen with right wisdom as it
has come to be: “This is false.” This, O bhikkhus, is one mode
of seeing. Of the deva, māra and brahma worlds, together with the population
of samanas and brahmanas, devas and humans, that which is looked upon as:
“This is false,” that the noble ones have well seen with right
wisdom as it has come to be: “This is the truth.” This, O
bhikkhus, is the second mode of seeing. Rightly seeing in accordance with
such and such duality, O bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu who dwells ever vigilant,
ardent and resolute, of two fruits a certain fruit is to be expected: “In
just this very life final knowledge, or non-returning [if] there is residue
remaining.” This is what the Auspicious One said. Having said this,
the Well-farer, the Teacher, further said this:

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   759. “Conceiving a self in the non-self,<br> see the world, with its
devas;<br> entrenched in name-and-form,<br> it conceives: “This is the
truth.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   760. Indeed, in whatever way they conceive,<br> from that it becomes
otherwise;<br> that indeed is the falsity of that,<br> because of its fleeting
deceptive nature.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   761. Nibbāna is of non-deceptive nature,<br> that the noble ones know as the
truth;<br> surely, by the penetration of that truth,<br> they are wishless,
fully extinguished.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
If, O bhikkhus, you are questioned further thus: Might there also be another
method by which [there is] right seeing in accordance with a duality? There
might be, should be said. And how might there be? O bhikkhus, of the deva,
māra and brahma worlds, together with the population of samanas and
brahmanas, devas and humans, that which is looked upon as: “This is
pleasure,” that the noble ones have well seen with right wisdom as
it has come to be: “This is suffering.” This, O bhikkhus, is one
mode of seeing. Of the deva, māra and brahma worlds, together with the
population of samanas and brahmanas, devas and humans, that which is looked
upon as: “This is suffering,” that the noble ones have well seen
with right wisdom as it has come to be: “This is pleasure.”
This, O bhikkhus, is the second mode of seeing. Rightly seeing in accordance
with such and such duality, O bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu who dwells ever
vigilant, ardent and resolute, of two fruits a certain fruit is to be
expected: “in just this very life final knowledge, or non-returning [if]
there is residue remaining.” This is what the Auspicious One
said. Having said this, the Well-farer, the Teacher, further said this:

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   762. “Forms, sounds, flavours, aromas,<br> contacts, dhammas, and its
entirety;<br> are desirable, lovely, pleasing,<br> but to the extent that it is
said: ‘“They exist.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   763. Of the world with its devas,<br> these are deemed a pleasure by them;<br>
wherein if those cease,<br> that is deemed suffering for them.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   764. The noble ones have seen as happiness,<br> the destruction of
personification;<br> this is contradicted,<br> by what the whole world sees.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   765. That which others have said is pleasure,<br> that the noble ones have
said is suffering;<br> that which others have said is suffering,<br> that the
noble ones have known as pleasure.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   766. See this Dhamma, difficult to understand,<br> here the fools are
bewildered;<br> they are enveloped in ignorance,<br> the ones in darkness, not
seeing.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   767. But to the good it is made clear,<br> just like light to those who see;<br>
present [yet] there is no understanding,<br> for beasts not well-versed in the
Dhamma.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   768. Overcome by lust for being,<br> [flowing] along the stream of being;<br>
well-settled in Mara's realm,<br> this Dhamma is not easy to awaken to.
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   769. Who apart from the noble ones,<br> are worthy to awaken to the path;<br>
that path which by its right understanding,<br> they are asava-free, fully
extinguished.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
This is what the Auspicious One said. Delighted, those bhikkhus rejoiced in
the Auspicious One's words. Still while this discourse was being spoken, the
minds of sixty bhikkhus were liberated from the asavas by non-holding.
