There are, O Potthapada, some samanas and brahmanas who hold such doctrine,
such view: “The self is entirely pleasurable and free from sickness after
death.” Having approached them I say thus: Is it true as reported,
that you venerables hold such doctrine, such view: “The self is entirely
pleasurable and free from sickness after death.” Being asked by me
thus, if they acknowledge: “Yes”, I say to them thus: “But do
you venerables abide knowing and seeing an entirely pleasurable
world?” Being asked thus, they say no. Then I say to them thus:
“But do you venerables contemplate an entirely pleasureable self for one
day or night or half a day or night?” Being asked thus, they say
no. Then I say to them thus: “But do you venerables know: This is the
way, this is the path for the realization of an entirely pleasurable
world?” Being asked thus, they say no. Then I say to them thus:
“Are there devas who report saying: Listen dear sirs, you should enter
upon the right path, dear sirs, you should enter upon the straight path for
the realization of an entirely pleasurable world? Indeed we too, dear sirs,
having entered upon that path thus, have arisen in an entirely pleasurable
world.” Being asked thus, they say no.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
“So what do you think, O Potthapada, that being so, doesn't the
statements of those samanas and brahmanas turn out to be less than
stellar?”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
“Certainly, O Bhante, that being so, the statements of those samanas and
brahmanas turn out to be less than stellar.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Suppose, O Potthapada, a man would say thus: “Whoever is the beauty queen
in this country, it is she that I wish for, she that I have a liking
for.” They would say thus: “Good man, that beauty queen in this
country whom you wish for and have a liking for, do you know whether that
beauty queen is a khattiya or brahman or vessa or sudda?” Thus
asked, he would say: “No.” They would say thus: “Good man,
that beauty queen in this country whom you wish for and have a liking for,
do you know whether that beauty queen is of such a name or such a clan;
tall, short, or medium height; of dark, fair or light skin complexion; in
such and such village, town or city?” Thus asked, he would say:
“No.” They would say thus: “Good man, do you wish for and
have a liking for that which you do not know, do not see?” Thus
asked, he would say: “Yes.”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“So what do you think, O Potthapada, that being so, doesn't the
statements of that man turn out to be less than stellar?”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
“Certainly, O Bhante, that being so, the statements of that man turn out
to be less than stellar.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
So too, O Potthapada, there are some samanas and brahmanas who hold such
doctrine, such view: “The self is entirely pleasurable and free from
sickness after death.” Having approached them I say thus: Is it
true as reported, that you venerables hold such doctrine, such view: “The

This is the way, this is the path for the realization of an entirely

statements of those samanas and brahmanas turn out to be less than
stellar?”

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
“Certainly, O Bhante, that being so, the statements of those samanas and
brahmanas turn out to be less than stellar.”

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Suppose, O Potthapada, a man were to build a stair case at the crossroads
ascending to a palace. They would say thus: “Good man, that palace to
which this staircase you are building will ascend to, do you know if it is
in the eastern direction or the southern direction or the western direction
or the northern direction or high or low or medium height?” Thus
asked, he would say: “No.” They would say thus: “Good man,
are you building a staircase that will ascent to a palace which you do not
know and do not see?” Thus asked, he would say: “Yes.”

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
“So what do you think, O Potthapada, that being so, doesn't the
statements of that man turn out to be less than stellar?”

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
“Certainly, O Bhante, that being so, the statements of that man turn out
to be less than stellar.”

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
So too, O Potthapada, there are some samanas and brahmanas who hold such
doctrine, such view: “The self is entirely pleasurable and free from
sickness after death.” Having approached them I say thus: Is it
true as reported, that you venerables hold such doctrine, such view: “The
self is entirely pleasurable and free from sickness after death.”
Being asked by me thus, if they acknowledge: “Yes”, I say to

“So what do you think, O Potthapada, that being so, doesn't the
statements of those samanas and brahmanas turn out to be less than

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
“Certainly, O Bhante, that being so, the statements of those samanas and
brahmanas turn out to be less than stellar.”

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
“There are, O Potthapada, these three acquisitions of self, the gross
acquisition of self, the mind-made acquisition of self, the formless
acquisition of self.”

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
And what, O Poṭṭhāpāda, is the gross acquisition of self? It is possessed of
form, consisting of the four great elements, feeding on food made into
lumps, this is the gross acquisition of self.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
What is the mind-made acquisition of self? It is possessed of form,
mind-made complete in all its factors, not lacking in any sense
faculty. This is the mind-made acquisition of self.

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
What is the formless acquisition of self? It is formless, made of
perception. This is the formless acquisition of self.

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
“I teach the Dhamma, O Potthapada, for the abandoning of the gross
acquisition of self in such a way that having entered upon the path, your
defiling nature will be abandoned, your purifying nature will increase and
you will in this very life enter upon and abide in the abundance and
perfection of wisdom, having realized it with your own supreme
knowledge.”

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
“It could be, O Potthapada, that it occurs to you thus: Our defiling
nature will be abandoned and purifying nature will increase, and we will in
this very life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of
wisdom, having realized it with our own supreme knowledge, yet abide in
suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
But this, O Potthapada, should not be seen thus. Certainly if your defiling
nature will be abandoned, your purifying nature will increase and you will
in this very life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of
wisdom, having realized it with your own supreme knowledge, there will be
only joy, happiness and tranquility, and you will abide in pleasure, mindful
and contemplative.”

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
“I also teach the Dhamma, O Potthapada, for the abandoning of the
mind-made acquisition of self in such a way that having entered upon the
path, your defiling nature will be abandoned, your purifying nature will
increase and you will in this very life enter upon and abide in the
abundance and perfection of wisdom, having realized it with your own supreme
knowledge.”

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
“It could be, O Potthapada, that it occurs to you thus: Our defiling
nature will be abandoned and purifying nature will increase, and we will in
this very life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of
wisdom, having realized it with our own supreme knowledge, yet abide in
suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
But this, O Potthapada, should not be seen thus. Certainly if your defiling
nature will be abandoned, your purifying nature will increase and you will
in this very life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of
wisdom, having realized it with your own supreme knowledge, there will be
only joy, happiness and tranquility, and you will abide in pleasure, mindful
and contemplative.”

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
“I also teach the Dhamma, O Potthapada, for the abandoning of the
formless acquisition of self in such a way that having entered upon the
path, your defiling nature will be abandoned, your purifying nature will
increase and you will in this very life enter upon and abide in the
abundance and perfection of wisdom, having realized it with your own supreme
knowledge.”

<p><span class="parno">27</span>
“It could be, O Potthapada, that it occurs to you thus: Our defiling
nature will be abandoned and purifying nature will increase, and we will in
this very life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of
wisdom, having realized it with our own supreme knowledge, yet abide in
suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">28</span>
But this, O Potthapada, should not be seen thus. Certainly if your defiling
nature will be abandoned, your purifying nature will increase and you will
in this very life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of
wisdom, having realized it with your own supreme knowledge, there will be
only joy, happiness and tranquility, and you will abide in pleasure, mindful
and contemplative.”

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
If, O Potthapada, others ask us thus: “But what, O friend, is that gross
acquisition of self for the abandoning of which you teach the Dhamma in such
a way that having entered upon the path, your defiling nature will be
abandoned, your purifying nature will increase and you will in this very
life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of wisdom, having
realized it with your own supreme knowledge.” For those who ask us
thus, we should answer them thus: “This, O friend, is the gross
acquisition of self for the abandoning of which we teach the Dhamma in such
a way that having entered upon the path, your defiling nature will be
abandoned, your purifying nature will increase and you will in this very
life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of wisdom, having
realized it with your own supreme knowledge.”

<p><span class="parno">30</span>
If, O Potthapada, others ask us thus: “But what, O friend, is that
mind-made acquisition of self for the abandoning of which you teach the
Dhamma in such a way that having entered upon the path, your defiling nature
will be abandoned, your purifying nature will increase and you will in this
very life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of wisdom,
having realized it with your own supreme knowledge.” For those who
ask us thus, we should answer them thus: “This, O friend, is the

having realized it with your own supreme knowledge.”

<p><span class="parno">31</span>
If, O Potthapada, others ask us thus: “But what, O friend, is that
formless acquisition of self for the abandoning of which you teach the
Dhamma in such a way that having entered upon the path, your defiling nature
will be abandoned, your purifying nature will increase and you will in this
very life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of wisdom,
having realized it with your own supreme knowledge.” For those who
ask us thus, we should answer them thus: “This, O friend, is the formless

a way that having entered upon the path, your defiling nature will be
abandoned, your purifying nature will increase and you will in this very
life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of wisdom, having
realized it with your own supreme knowledge.”

<p><span class="parno">32</span>
“So what do you think, O Potthapada, that being so, doesn't these
statements turn out to be awesome?”

<p><span class="parno">33</span>
“Certainly, O Bhante, that being so, these statements turn out to be
awesome.”

<p><span class="parno">34</span>
Suppose, O Potthapada, a man were to build a staircase ascending to a palace
just underneath the palace. They would say thus: “Good man, that palace
to which this staircase you are building will ascend to, do you know if it
is in the eastern direction or the southern direction or the western
direction or the northern direction; high or low or medium height?”
If he would say thus: “This, O friend, is that palace to which this
staircase ascends.”

<p><span class="parno">35</span>
“So what do you think, O Potthapada, that being so, doesn't the
statements of that man turn out to be awesome?”

<p><span class="parno">36</span>
“Certainly, O Bhante, that being so, the statements of that man turn out
to be awesome.”

<p><span class="parno">37</span>
So too, O Potthapada, if others ask us thus: “But what, O friend, is that
gross acquisition of self for the abandoning of which you teach the Dhamma
in such a way that having entered upon the path, your defiling nature will
be abandoned, your purifying nature will increase and you will in this very
life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of wisdom, having
realized it with your own supreme knowledge.” For those who ask us
thus, we should answer them thus: “This, O friend, is the gross

realized it with your own supreme knowledge.”

<p><span class="parno">38</span>
So too, O Potthapada, if others ask us thus: “But what, O friend, is that
mind-made acquisition of self for the abandoning of which you teach the
Dhamma in such a way that having entered upon the path, your defiling nature
will be abandoned, your purifying nature will increase and you will in this
very life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of wisdom,
having realized it with your own supreme knowledge.” For those who
ask us thus, we should answer them thus: “This, O friend, is the

Dhamma in such a way that having entered upon the path, your defiling nature
will be abandoned, your purifying nature will increase and you will in this
very life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of wisdom,
having realized it with your own supreme knowledge.”

<p><span class="parno">39</span>
So too, O Potthapada, if others ask us thus: “But what, O friend, is that
formless acquisition of self for the abandoning of which you teach the
Dhamma in such a way that having entered upon the path, your defiling nature
will be abandoned, your purifying nature will increase and you will in this
very life enter upon and abide in the abundance and perfection of wisdom,
having realized it with your own supreme knowledge.” For those who
ask us thus, we should answer them thus: “This, O friend, is the formless

realized it with your own supreme knowledge.”

<p><span class="parno">40</span>
“So what do you think, O Potthapada, that being so, doesn't these
statements turn out to be awesome?”

<p><span class="parno">41</span>
“Certainly, O Bhante, that being so, these statements turn out to be
awesome.”

<p><span class="parno">42</span>
When thus was said, Citta Hatthisariputta said this to the Auspicious One:
“On the occasion, O Bhante, when there is the gross acquisition of self,
on that occasion is the mind-made acquisition of self and the formless
acquisition of self false and only the gross acquisition of self true? On
the occasion, O Bhante, when there is the mind-made acquisition of self, on
that occasion is the gross acquisition of self and the formless acquisition
of self false and only the mind-made acquisition of self true? On the
occasion, O Bhante, when there is the formless acquisition of self, on that
occasion is the gross acquisition of self and the mind-made acquisition of
self false and only the formless acquisition of self true?”

<p><span class="parno">43</span>
“On the occasion, O Citta, when there is the gross acquisition of self,
on that occasion it is neither reckoned as a mind-made acquisition of self
nor a formless acquisition of self. On that occasion it is only reckoned as
the gross acquisition of self.” “On the occasion, O Citta, when
there is the mind-made acquisition of self, on that occasion it is neither
reckoned as a gross acquisition of self nor a formless acquisition of
self. On that occasion it is only reckoned as the mind-made acquisition of
self.” “On the occasion, O Citta, when there is the formless
acquisition of self, on that occasion it is neither reckoned as a gross
acquisition of self nor a mind-made acquisition of self. On that occasion it
is only reckoned as the formless acquisition of self.”

<p><span class="parno">44</span>
“If, O Citta, you were to be asked thus: “Were you in the past. Is it
not the case that you were not? Will you be in the future. Is it not the
case that you will not? Is there you now? Is it not the case that there is
not you?” Thus asked, O Citta, how would you answer?”

<p><span class="parno">45</span>
“If, O Bhante, I were to be asked thus: “Were you in the past? Is it
not the case that you were not? Will you be in the future? Is it not the
case that you will not? Is there you now? is it not the case that there is
not you?” Thus asked, O Bhante, I would answer thus: “I was in
the past, it is not the case that I was not. I will be in the future. It is
not the case that I will not. There is I now. It is not the case that there
is not I.” Thus asked, O Bhante, I would answer thus.”

<p><span class="parno">46</span>
“But if, O Citta, you were to be asked thus: “The past acquisition of
self, is only that true, the future and present being false? The future
acquisition of self, will only that be true, the past and the present being
false? The present acquisition of self, is only this true, the past and the
future being false?” Thus asked, O Citta, how would you
answer?”

<p><span class="parno">47</span>
“But if, O Bhante, I were to be asked thus: “The past acquisition of
self, is only that true, the future and present being false? The future
acquisition of self, will only that be true, the past and the present being
false? The present acquisition of self, is only this true, the past and the
future being false?” Thus asked, O Bhante, I would answer thus:
“That past acquisition of self of mine, only that was true on that
occasion, the future and present being false? The future acquisition of self
of mine, only that will be true on that occasion, the past and the present
being false? The present acquisition of self of mine, only this is true, the
past and the future being false. Thus asked, O Bhante, I would answer
thus.”

<p><span class="parno">48</span>
“So too, O Citta, on the occasion, when there is the gross acquisition of
self, on that occasion it is neither reckoned as a mind-made acquisition of
self nor a formless acquisition of self. On that occasion it is only
reckoned as the gross acquisition of self.” “On the occasion, O
Citta, when there is the mind-made acquisition of self, on that occasion it
is neither reckoned as a gross acquisition of self nor a formless
acquisition of self. On that occasion it is only reckoned as the mind-made
acquisition of self.” “On the occasion, O Citta, when there is
the formless acquisition of self, on that occasion it is neither reckoned as
a gross acquisition of self nor a mind-made acquisition of self. On that
occasion it is only reckoned as the formless acquisition of self.”

<p><span class="parno">49</span>
Just as, O Citta, from cow comes milk, from milk, curds, from curds, butter,
from butter, ghee, from ghee, creme of ghee. On the occasion when there is
milk, it is neither reckoned as curds, nor butter, nor ghee, nor creme of

there is curds, it is neither reckoned as milk, nor butter, nor ghee, nor
creme of ghee. On that occasion, it is only reckoned as curds. On the
occasion when there is butter, it is neither reckoned as milk, nor curds,
nor ghee, nor creme of ghee. On that occasion, it is only reckoned as
butter. On the occasion when there is ghee, it is neither reckoned as milk,
nor curds, nor butter, nor creme of ghee. On that occasion, it is only

reckoned as milk, nor curds, nor butter, nor ghee. On that occasion, it is
only reckoned as creme of ghee. [So too], on the occasion, when there is the
gross acquisition of self, on that occasion it is neither reckoned as a
mind-made acquisition of self nor a formless acquisition of self. On that
occasion it is only reckoned as the gross acquisition of self.”
“On the occasion, O Citta, when there is the mind-made acquisition of
self, on that occasion it is neither reckoned as a gross acquisition of self
nor a formless acquisition of self. On that occasion it is only reckoned as
the mind-made acquisition of self.” “On the occasion, O Citta,
when there is the formless acquisition of self, on that occasion it is
neither reckoned as a gross acquisition of self nor a mind-made acquisition
of self. On that occasion it is only reckoned as the formless acquisition of
self.”

<p><span class="parno">50</span>
These, O Citta, are worldly expressions, worldly language, worldly
appellations, worldly designations that the Tathagata expresses without
attachment.

<p><span class="parno">51</span>
When thus was said, Potthapada, the wanderer, said this to the Auspicious
One: “Excellent, O Bhante! Excellent, O Bhante! Just as, O Bhante, one
might set upright what has been overturned, or open up what has been closed,
or show a path to one who is lost, or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so
that those with good eyesight can see forms, just so, O Bhante, has the
Dhamma been explained by the Auspicious One in countless ways. I go, O
Bhante, to the Auspicious One as refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the
Sangha of bhikkhus. O Bhante, may the Auspicious One bear it in mind, that I
am a lay disciple who has gone for refuge from today for as long as life
lasts.”

<p><span class="parno">52</span>
But Citta Hatthisariputta said this to the Auspicious One: “Excellent, O
Bhante! Excellent, O Bhante! Just as, O Bhante, one might set upright what
has been overturned, or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one
who is lost, or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so that those with good
eyesight can see forms, just so, O Bhante, has the Dhamma been explained by
the Auspicious One in countless ways. I go, O Bhante, to the Auspicious One,
as refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Bhikkhu Sangha. May I gain the
going forth in the Auspicious One's presence, may I obtain the higher
ordination.”

<p><span class="parno">53</span>
Citta Hatthisariputta gained the going-forth in the Auspicious One's
presence, gained the higher ordination. Not long after his higher
ordination, the venerable Citta Hatthisariputta, dwelling alone, withdrawn,
vigilant, ardent, resolute, not long entered upon and dwelled in that
unsurpassed consummation of the life of purity for the sake of which sons of
clansmen justly and rightly go forth from the household life into
homelessness, having realized it with his own supreme knowledge in just this
very life. He understood: “Destroyed is birth, lived is the life of
purity, done is what had to be done, there is no other for
thusness.” And the venerable Citta Hatthisariputta became one of
the arahants.
