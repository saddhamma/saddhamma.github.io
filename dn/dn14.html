<p><span class="parno">64</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, for the Bodhisatta Vipassi, gone to a lonely place in his
dwelling, while he was in seclusion, a reflection arose in his mind thus:
“Indeed this world has fallen into difficulty, [in that] it is born,
becomes old, and dies, passes away and arises, but now does not understand
the stepping out of this suffering, of old age and death. When indeed will
the stepping out of this suffering, of old age and death become
evident?”

<p><span class="parno">65</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Old age and
death come to be when there is what herein, in dependence on what is there
old age and death?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta Vipassi's
root cause consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by wisdom: “Old
age and death come to be when there is birth herein, in dependence on birth,
there are old age and death.”

<p><span class="parno">66</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Birth comes to
be when there is what herein, in dependence on what is there
birth?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta Vipassi's root cause
consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by wisdom: “Birth comes to
be when there is being herein, in dependence on being, there is
birth.”

<p><span class="parno">67</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Being comes to
be when there is what herein, in dependence on what is there
being?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta Vipassi's root cause
consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by wisdom: “Being comes to
be when there is undertaking herein, in dependence on undertaking, there is
being.”

<p><span class="parno">68</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Undertaking
comes to be when there is what herein, in dependence on what is there
undertaking?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta Vipassi's root
cause consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by wisdom:
“Undertaking comes to be when there is thirst herein, in dependence on
thirst, there is undertaking.”

<p><span class="parno">69</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Thirst comes to
be when there is what herein, in dependence on what is there
thirst?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta Vipassi's root cause
consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by wisdom: “Thirst comes
to be when there is feeling herein, in dependence on feeling, there is
thirst.”

<p><span class="parno">70</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Feeling comes
to be when there is what herein, in dependence on what is there
feeling?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta Vipassi's root
cause consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by wisdom: “Feeling
comes to be when there is contact herein, in dependence on contact, there is
feeling.”

<p><span class="parno">71</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Contact comes
to be when there is what herein, in dependence on what is there
contact?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta Vipassi's root
cause consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by wisdom: “Contact
comes to be when there are the six [sense] domains herein, in dependence on
the six [sense] domains, there is contact.”

<p><span class="parno">72</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “The six [sense]
domains come to be when there is what herein, in dependence on what are
there the six [sense] domains?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the
Bodhisatta Vipassi's root cause consideration, there came to be a
breakthrough by wisdom: “The six [sense] domains come to be when there is
name-and-form herein, in dependence on name-and-form, there is the six
[sense] domains.”

<p><span class="parno">73</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Name-and-form
comes to be when there is what herein, in dependence on what is there
name-and-form?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta Vipassi's
root cause consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by wisdom:
“Name-and-form comes to be when there is consciousness herein, in
dependence on consciousness, there is name-and-form.”

<p><span class="parno">74</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Consciousness
comes to be when there is what herein, in dependence on what is there
consciousness?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta Vipassi's
root cause consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by wisdom:
“Consciousness comes to be when there is name-and-form herein, in
dependence on name-and-form, there is consciousness.”

<p><span class="parno">75</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “This
consciousness returns again to name-and-form. It does not go further [from
name-and-form]. It is to that extent that all [beings] must be born, or all
[beings] must [reach] old age, or all [beings] must pass away, or all
[beings] must arise, that is, in dependence on name-and-form, there is
consciousness; in dependence on consciousness, there is name-and-form; in
dependence on name-and-form, there are the six [sense] domains; in
dependence on the six [sense] domains, there is contact; in dependence on
contact, there is feeling; in dependence on feeling, there is thirst; in
dependence on thirst, there is undertaking; in dependence on undertaking,
there is being; in dependence on being, there is birth; in dependence on
birth, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental
suffering and despair arise. Just so, is the arising of this entire
amassment of suffering.”

<p><span class="parno">76</span>
“Origination, origination,”, O bhikkhus, for the Bodhisatta
Vipassi, among dhammas unheard before, the eye arose, knowledge arose,
wisdom arose, noble knowledge arose, light arose.

<p><span class="parno">77</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Old age and
death do not come to be when there is not what herein, from the cessation of
what is there cessation of old age and death?” Then, O bhikkhus,
from the Bodhisatta Vipassi's root cause consideration, there came to be a
breakthrough by wisdom: “Old age and death do not come to be when there
is not birth herein, from the cessation of birth, there is the cessation of
old age and death.”

<p><span class="parno">78</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Birth does not
come to be when there is not what herein, from the cessation of what is
there cessation of birth?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta
Vipassi's root cause consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by
wisdom: “Birth does not come to be when there is not being herein, from
the cessation of being, there is the cessation of birth.”

<p><span class="parno">79</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Being does not
come to be when there is not what herein, from the cessation of what is
there cessation of being?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta
Vipassi's root cause consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by
wisdom: “Being does not come to be when there is not undertaking herein,
from the cessation of undertaking, there is the cessation of
being.”

<p><span class="parno">80</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Undertaking
does not come to be when there is not what herein, from the cessation of
what is there cessation of undertaking?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the
Bodhisatta Vipassi's root cause consideration, there came to be a
breakthrough by wisdom: “Undertaking does not come to be when there is
not thirst herein, from the cessation of thirst, there is the cessation of
undertaking.”

<p><span class="parno">81</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Thirst does not
come to be when there is not what herein, from the cessation of what is
there cessation of thirst?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta
Vipassi's root cause consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by
wisdom: “Thirst does not come to be when there is not feeling herein,
from the cessation of feeling, there is the cessation of thirst.”

<p><span class="parno">82</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Feeling does
not come to be when there is not what herein, from the cessation of what is
there cessation of feeling?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta
Vipassi's root cause consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by
wisdom: “Feeling does not come to be when there is not contact herein,
from the cessation of contact, there is the cessation of feeling.”

<p><span class="parno">83</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Contact does
not come to be when there is not what herein, from the cessation of what is
there cessation of contact?” Then, O bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta
Vipassi's root cause consideration, there came to be a breakthrough by
wisdom: “Contact does not come to be when there are not the six [sense]
domains herein, from the cessation of the six [sense] domains, there is the
cessation of contact.”

<p><span class="parno">84</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “The six [sense]
domains do not come to be when there is not what herein, from the cessation
of what is there cessation of the six [sense] domains?” Then, O
bhikkhus, from the Bodhisatta Vipassi's root cause consideration, there came
to be a breakthrough by wisdom: “The six [sense] domains do not come to
be when there is not name-and-form herein, from the cessation of
name-and-form, there is the cessation of the six [sense] domains.”

<p><span class="parno">85</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Name-and-form
does not come to be when there is not what herein, from the cessation of
what is there cessation of name-and-form?” Then, O bhikkhus, from
the Bodhisatta Vipassi's root cause consideration, there came to be a
breakthrough by wisdom: “Name-and-form does not come to be when there is
not consciousness herein, from the cessation of consciousness, there is the
cessation of name-and-form.”

<p><span class="parno">86</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “Consciousness
does not come to be when there is not what herein, from the cessation of
what is there cessation of consciousness?” Then, O bhikkhus, from
the Bodhisatta Vipassi's root cause consideration, there came to be a
breakthrough by wisdom: “Consciousness does not come to be when there is
not name-and-form herein, from the cessation of name-and-form, there is the
cessation of consciousness.”

<p><span class="parno">87</span>
Then, O bhikkhus, it occurred to the Bodhisatta Vipassi: “This path for
self-awakening has been attained by me. That is, from the cessation of
name-and-form, there is the cessation of consciousness; from the cessation
of consciousness, there is the cessation of name-and-form; from the
cessation of name-and-form, there is the cessation of the six [sense]
domains, from the cessation of the six [sense] domains, there is the
cessation of contact; from the cessation of contact, there is the cessation
of feeling; from the cessation of feeling, there is the cessation of thirst;
from the cessation of thirst, there is the cessation of undertaking; from
the cessation of undertaking, there is the cessation of being; from the
cessation of being, there is the cessation of birth; from the cessation of
birth, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental
suffering and despair cease. Just so, is the cessation of this entire stock
of suffering.” “Cessation, cessation,” O bhikkhus, for
the Bodhisatta Vipassi, among dhammas unheard before, the eye arose,
knowledge arose, wisdom arose, noble knowledge arose, light arose.

<p><span class="parno">88</span>
“So then, O bhikkhus, on another occasion, the Bodhisatta Vipassi dwelled
as one who perceives in accordance with the arising and vanishing in the
five stocks of appropriation: [thus]: “Such is form, such is form's
arising, such is form's disappearance, such is feeling, such is feeling's
arising, such is feeling's disappearance, such is perception, such is
perception's arising, such is perception's disappearance, such are
sankharas, such are sankharas' arising, such are sankharas' disappearance,
such is consciousness, such is consciousness's arising, such is
consciousness's disappearance.” Of him dwelling as one who
perceives in accordance with the arising and vanishing in the five stocks of
appropriation, in just no long [time], by not having appropriated, his mind
was liberated from the asavas.”
