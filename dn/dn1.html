<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One entered upon the high
road between Rajagaha and Nalanda with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with
about five hundred bhikkhus. The wanderer Suppiya, had also entered upon the
high road between Rajagaha and Nalanda with his pupil, the brahmin youth
Brahmadatta. There, the wanderer Suppiya, in various ways, only spoke in
dispraise of the Buddha, spoke in dispraise of the Dhamma, spoke in
dispraise of the Sangha. However, the wanderer Suppiya's pupil, the brahmin
youth Brahmadatta, in various ways, spoke in praise of the Buddha, spoke in
praise of the Dhamma, spoke in praise of the Sangha. Thus indeed, both
teacher and pupil spoke directly opposing one another as they followed
behind the Auspicious One and the Bhikkhu Sangha.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Later on, the Auspicious One entered the King's Cottage at Ambalatthika with
the Bhikkhu Sangha to spend one night. The wanderer Suppiya also entered the
King's Cottage at Ambalatthika with his pupil, brahmin youth Brahmadatta, to
spend one night. There too, the wanderer Suppiya, in various ways, only
spoke in dispraise of the Buddha, spoke in dispraise of the Dhamma, spoke in
dispraise of the Sangha. However, the wanderer Suppiya's pupil, the brahmin
youth Brahmadatta, in various ways, spoke in praise of the Buddha, spoke in
praise of the Dhamma, spoke in praise of the Sangha. Thus indeed, both
teacher and pupil spoke directly opposing one another as they dwelled.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Then, as the night [turned to] early morning, many bhikkhus having arisen,
having assembled at the round pavilion, this topic of conversation arose as
they settled: “It is marvellous, O friends. It is unprecedented, O
friends, in so far as the Auspicious One who knows and sees, the Arahant,
the rightly self-awakened One, has well known the diverse dispositions of
beings. Indeed, this wanderer Suppiya, in various ways, spoke in dispraise
of the Buddha, spoke in dispraise of the Dhamma, spoke in dispraise of the
Sangha. However, the wanderer Suppiya's pupil, the brahmin youth
Brahmadatta, in various ways, spoke in praise of the Buddha, spoke in praise
of the Dhamma, spoke in praise of the Sangha. Thus indeed, both teacher and
pupil spoke directly opposing one another as they followed behind the
Auspicious One and the Bhikkhu Sangha.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Then the Auspicious One, having known the topic of conversation of those
bhikkhus, went to the round pavilion. Upon arrival, he sat down on a
prepared seat. Having sat down, the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus:
“What form of conversation, O bhikkhus, were you having now as you have
settled here, having assembled? And what was the talk underway that was left
unfinished by you?” When thus was said, those bhikkhus said this to
the Auspicious One: “Here, O Bhante, as the night turned to early
morning, we, having arisen, having assembled at the round pavilion, this
topic of conversation arose as we settled: “It is marvellous, O
friends. It is unprecedented, O friends, in so far as the Auspicious One who
knows and sees, the Arahant, the rightly self-awakened One, has well known
the diverse dispositions of beings. Indeed, this wanderer Suppiya, in
various ways, spoke in dispraise of the Buddha, spoke in dispraise of the
Dhamma, spoke in dispraise of the Sangha. However, the wanderer Suppiya's
pupil, the brahmin youth Brahmadatta, in various ways, spoke in praise of
the Buddha, spoke in praise of the Dhamma, spoke in praise of the
Sangha. Thus indeed, both teacher and pupil spoke directly opposing one
another as they followed behind the Auspicious One and the Bhikkhu
Sangha.” This, O Bhante, was the talk underway that was left
unfinished by us. Then the Auspicious One arrived.”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“O bhikkhus, should others speak in dispraise of me, or should speak in
dispraise of the Dhamma, or should speak in dispraise of the Sangha, no
malice, no discontentment, no resentment in the mind is to be done by you. O
bhikkhus, should others speak in dispraise of me, or should speak in
dispraise of the Dhamma, or should speak in dispraise of the Sangha, if
there is annoyance or displeasure in you therein, that is a hindrance for
you alone. O bhikkhus, should others speak in dispraise of me, or should
speak in dispraise of the Dhamma, or should speak in dispraise of the
Sangha, if there is annoyance or displeasure in you therein, would you
understand of others [what is] well-spoken and badly-spoken?”
“Certainly not, Bhante.” O bhikkhus, should others speak in
dispraise of me, or should speak in dispraise of the Dhamma, or should speak
in dispraise of the Sangha, you should unravel the false from the false
therein: “Such as this is false. Such as this is untrue. But there is not
this in us. On the contrary, this is not to be found in us.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
“O bhikkhus, should others speak in praise of me, or should speak in
praise of the Dhamma, or should speak in praise of the Sangha, no rejoicing,
no mental pleasure, no elation in the mind is to be done by you. O bhikkhus,
should others speak in praise of me, or should speak in praise of the
Dhamma, or should speak in praise of the Sangha, if there is rejoicing or
gladness in you therein, that is a hindrance for you alone. O bhikkhus,
should others speak in praise of me, or should speak in praise of the
Dhamma, or should speak in praise of the Sangha, you should acknowledge the
truth from the truth therein: “Such as this is true. Such as this is
correct. And there is this in us. And still, this is to be found in
us.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
“But this, O bhikkhus, is a trifling, insignificant, mere virtue, by
which one who is a puthujjana might say when speaking in praise of the
Tathagata.” “And which, O bhikkhus, is that trifling,
insignificant, mere virtue by which one who is a puthujjana might say when
speaking in praise of the Tathagata?”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
“Having abandoned the killing of living beings, the samana Gotama
abstains from the killing of living beings. Having buried the rod, having
buried the sword, he dwells conscientious, with kindness and sympathy,
compassionate for the welfare for all living beings.” It is indeed
thus, O bhikkhus, that a puthujjana speaking in praise of the Tathagata
might say.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
“Having abandoned the taking of what is not given, the samana Gotama
abstains from taking what is not given, accepting what is given, expecting
what is given. By not theiving, he dwells having become pure
himself.” Or it is indeed thus, O bhikkhus, that a puthujjana
speaking in praise of the Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
“Having abandoned unchastity, the samana Gotama is a celibate one, living
apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the villager's habit.”
Or it is indeed thus, O bhikkhus, that a puthujjana speaking in praise of
the Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
“Having abandoned false speech, the samana Gotama abstains from false
speech. He speaks the truth. He is dependable, reliable, trustworthy, not a
deceiver of the world.” Or it is indeed thus, O bhikkhus, that a
puthujjana speaking in praise of the Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
“Having abandoned divisive speech, the samana Gotama abstains from
divisive speech. Having heard from here, he does not tell there to divide
these [from those], or having heard from there, he does not tell here to
divide those [from these]. Thus is he, a reconciler of the divided, a
bestower of togetherness. He delights in harmony, is delighted with harmony,
rejoices in harmony, utters speech that creates harmony.” Or it is
indeed thus, O bhikkhus, that a puthujjana speaking in praise of the
Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
“Having abandoned harsh speech, the samana Gotama abstains from harsh
speech. That speech which is gentle, pleasant to the ear, endearing,
heartwarming, polite, pleasing to many, agreeable to many, that form of
speech he utters.” Or it is indeed thus, O bhikkhus, that a
puthujjana speaking in praise of the Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
“Having abandoned senseless prattle, the samana Gotama abstains from
senseless prattle. He speaks at the proper time, [speech that is] truthful,
meaningful, in accordance with the Dhamma, in accordance with the Vinaya,
speech worth treasuring, at the proper time he utters speech that is
reasonable, speech worth remembering, speech connected with
profit.” Or it is indeed thus, O bhikkhus, that a puthujjana
speaking in praise of the Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
“The samana Gotama abstains from injuring seed life and vegetation. The

discipline. How can you understand this dhamma and discipline? You have

poetry, and moral philosophy. The samana Gotama abstains from such or such
forms of wrong livelihood.” Or it is indeed thus, O bhikkhus, that
a puthujjana speaking in praise of the Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">31</span>
“Whereas some honorable samanas and brahmanas, having eating food offered
in faith, they earn their living by such forms of wrong livelihood of animal
sciences such as: getting a wife for a young man; getting a husband for a
young woman; arranging engagements; arranging divorces; advising on times
for savings; advising on times for spending; invoking good luck; invoking
bad luck; reviving fetuses; [reciting:] incantations to bind the tongue;
incantations to cause dumbness; incantations to cause vomiting; incantations
to bind the jaw; whispering in the ear; questioning a mirror as an oracle;
questioning a girl as an oracle; questioning a deva as an oracle; worshiping
the sun; worshiping the Great Brahma; spitting out fire; invoking the
goddess of luck. The samana Gotama abstains from such or such forms of wrong
livelihood.” Or it is indeed thus, O bhikkhus, that a puthujjana
speaking in praise of the Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">32</span>
“Whereas some honorable samanas and brahmanas, having eating food offered

sciences such as: [performing:] rituals for peace, rituals for aspirations,
rituals for wisdom, rituals for rainfall, rituals for infertility, rituals
for sites, ceremonies for sites, consecration of sites, ceremonial rinsing
of the mouth, ceremonial bathing, offering of sacrifices, administering
emetics, administering purgatives, administering up-going purgatives,
administering down-going purgatives, administering head purgatives,
administering ear ointments, administering eye restoratives, administering
nasal medicine, administering ointments and counter-ointments; practising
fine surgery; practising general surgery; practising as a children's doctor;
the application of medicinal roots; the binding on of medicinal herbs and
remedies. The samana Gotama abstains from such or such forms of wrong
livelihood.” Or it is indeed thus, O bhikkhus, that a puthujjana
speaking in praise of the Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">33</span>
This, O bhikkhus, is the trifling, insignificant, mere virtue, by which one
who is a puthujjana might say when speaking in praise of the Tathagata.

<p><span class="parno">34</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, also other dhammas that are deep, difficult to see,
difficult to awaken to, peaceful, excellent, not within the sphere of
reasoning, subtle, to be directly experienced by the wise, which the
Tathagata, having realized by himself with higher knowledge, causes to make
them known, by which those who rightly speak in praise of the Tathagata in
conformity with the truth might say. And which, O bhikkhus, are those
dhammas that are deep, difficult to see, difficult to awaken to, peaceful,
excellent, not within the sphere of reasoning, subtle, to be directly
experienced by the wise, which the Tathagata, having realized by himself
with higher knowledge, causes to make them known, by which those who rightly
speak in praise of the Tathagata in conformity with the truth might say?

<p><span class="parno">35</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas who are past world-cycle
theorists, who [hold] views in line with the past, who assert various
theories concerning the past by eighteen grounds. Owing to what, having
regard for what, [do] those honorable samanas and brahmanas who are past
world-cycle theorists, who [hold] views in line with the past, assert
various theories concerning the past by these eighteen grounds?

<p><span class="parno">36</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas whose teaching is
eternalism, who declare the self and the world [to be] eternal by four
grounds. Owing to what, having regard for what, [do] those honorable samanas
and brahmanas declare the self and the world [to be] eternal by four

<p><span class="parno">37</span>
“Here, O bhikkhus, a certain samana or brahmana, in consequence of
ardour, in consequence of endeavour, in consequence of application, in
consequence of vigilance, in consequence of right attention, mentally
touches such a form of samadhi where in that state of mind, he recollects
his manifold past abodes, that is: one birth, two births, three births, four
births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births,
fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand
births, many hundreds of births, many thousands of births, many hundreds of
thousands of births. “There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an
appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain,
such my life span; and passing away from there, I appeared elsewhere; and
there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was
my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span;
and passing away from there, I appeared here.” Thus with their
aspects and particulars, he recollects his manifold past abodes. He says
thus: The self and the world are eternal, barren, permanent, as stable as a
pillar, immovable. It is just beings that run through, move about
continuously, passing away and re-arising. There is only this forever and
ever. What is the reason for that? Because I, in consequence of ardour, in

this: Whereas the self and the world are eternal, barren, permanent, as
stable as a pillar, immovable, beings run through, move about continuously,
passing away and re-arising, there is only this forever and ever.”
This, O bhikkhus, is the first ground owing to which, having regard for
which, some samanas and brahmanas whose teaching is eternalism declare the
self and  the world to be eternal.

<p><span class="parno">38</span>
And in the second place, owing to what, having regard for what, [do] those
honorable samanas and brahmanas whose teaching is eternalism, declare the
self and the world to be eternal? “Here, O bhikkhus, a certain samana or

having regard for which some samanas and brahmanas whose teaching is
eternalism declare the self and  the world to be eternal.

<p><span class="parno">39</span>
And in the third place, owing to what, having regard for what, [do] those
honorable samanas and brahmanas whose teaching is eternalism, declare the

regard for which some samanas and brahmanas whose teaching is eternalism
declare the self and the world to be eternal.

<p><span class="parno">40</span>
And in the fourth place, owing to what, having regard for what, [do] those
honorable samanas and brahmanas whose teaching is eternalism, declare the
self and the world to be eternal? “Here, O bhikkhus, a certain samana or
brahmana is a logician, an investigator. Having hammered out by
argumentations accompanied by investigation according to his own
intelligence, he says thus: The self and the world are eternal, barren,
permanent, as stable as a pillar, immovable. It is just beings that run

owing to which, having regard for which some samanas and brahmanas whose
teaching is eternalism declare the self and  the world to be eternal.

<p><span class="parno">41</span>
Indeed, it is these, O bhikkhus, by which those samanas and brahmanas whose
teaching is eternalism declare the self and the world [to be] eternal by
four grounds. Indeed, O bhikkhus, whichever samanas or brahmanas, whose
teaching is eternalism, who declare the self and the world [to be] eternal,
all those [do so] by only these four grounds or by a certain one [among]
these. Aside from these there is none.

<p><span class="parno">42</span>
That, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata understands this: “These standpoint for
views, thus welcome, thus held on to, thus grasped, they will lead to such
after death state.” And that the Tathagata understands what
transcends that understanding, and not being attached to that understanding,
and not holding to it, he has just known personal extinguishing by final
knowledge. And having known as they have come to be the arising, the
extinction, the gratification, the liability and the stepping out of
feelings, not having appropriated, the Tathagata, O bhikkhus, is liberated.

<p><span class="parno">43</span>
These, O bhikkhus, are really those dhammas that are deep, difficult to see,
difficult to awaken to, peaceful, most excellent, not within the sphere of
reasoning, subtle, to be directly experienced by the wise, which the
Tathagata, having realized by himself with higher knowledge, causes to make
them known, by which those who rightly speak in praise of the Tathagata in
conformity with the truth might say.

<p><span class="parno">44</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas who are partial eternal
and partial non-eternal theorizers, who declare the self and the world [to
be] partially eternal and partially non-eternal by four grounds. Owing to
what, having regard for what, [do] those honorable samanas and brahmanas
declare the self and the world [to be] partially eternal and partially
non-eternal by four grounds?

<p><span class="parno">45</span>
At some time or other, O bhikkhus, there comes to be a long lapse of time
which this world contracts. In a contracting world, the majority of beings
are mostly Abhassara [brahma world] bound. There they are mind-made, feeding
on rapture, self-luminous, roaming through the air, ever beautiful, and they
remain like that for a very long time. At some time or other, O bhikkhus,
there comes to be a long lapse of time which this world expands. In an
expanding world, an empty brahma palace appears. Then a certain being,
having passed away from the Abhassara group [due to] the exhaustion of life
or exhaustion of merits, arises in the empty brahma palace. There he is
mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, roaming through the air, ever
beautiful, and he remains like that for a very long time. Of him being alone
in that place for a long time, an uneasiness, discontent and longing arises:
“O, that other beings too were to come to this state.” Then
certain beings too, having passed away from the Abhassara group [due to] the
exhaustion of life or exhaustion of merits, arise in the brahma palace in
companionship of that being. Those too are mind-made, feeding on rapture,
self-luminous, roaming through the air, ever beautiful, and they remain like
that for a very long time. There, O bhikkhus, the being who arose first, it
occurs to him thus: “I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the
Unconquered, the All Seeing, the Wielder of Power, the Master, the Maker and
Creator, the Foremost, the Ordainer, the Almighty, the Father of all that
are and are to be. These beings are created by me. What is the reason for
that? Formerly this occurred to me: “O, that other beings too were to
come to this state;” and because of such mental aspiration of mine,
these beings have come to this state.” Those beings too who arose
afterwards, it occurs to those too: “This is Brahmā, the Great Brahmā,
the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All Seeing, the Wielder of Power, the
Master, the Maker and Creator, the Foremost, the Ordainer, the Almighty, the
Father of all that are and are to be. In this way we were created by
Brahma. What is the reason for that? Because we see that he arose here
first. However, we arose afterwards.”

<p><span class="parno">46</span>
There, O bhikkhus, the being who arose first is longer lived, more beautiful
and possesses greater power. However, those beings who arose afterwards are
shorter lived, less beautiful and possess less power. But it is possible, O
bhikkhus, it is to be found that a certain being, having passed away from
that group comes to this state of existence. Having come to this state of
existence, he is one who goes forth from the house [life] into
homelessness. Being one who has gone forth from the house [life] into
homelessness, in consequence of ardour, in consequence of endeavour, in
consequence of application, in consequence of vigilance, in consequence of
right attention, he mentally touches such a form of samadhi where in that
state of mind, he recollects his former abode, [but apart] from there, he
does not recollect others. He says thus: “He who is Brahmā, the Great
Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All Seeing, the Wielder of
Power, the Master, the Maker and Creator, the Foremost, the Ordainer, the
Almighty, the Father of all that are and are to be, we were created by
Brahma. He is permanent, stable, eternal, not liable to change. He just
remains thus forever and ever. However, we who were created by Brahma, we
are impermanent, unstable, short lived, liable to fall away and come to this
state of existence.” This, O bhikkhus, is the first ground owing to
which, having regard for which some samanas and brahmanas who are partial
eternal and partial non-eternal theorizers declare the self and the world to
be partially eternal and partially non-eternal.

<p><span class="parno">47</span>
And in the second place, owing to what, having regard for what, [do] those
honorable samanas and brahmanas who are partial eternal and partial
non-eternal theorizers, declare the self and the world [to be] partially
eternal and partially non-eternal? There are, O bhikkhus, devas named
amusement revelers. They dwell excessively engaged in the habit of laughter
and enjoyment. Of those dwelling excessively engaged in the habit of
laughter and enjoyment, [their] mindfulness become muddled. With muddled
mindfulness those devas pass away from that group. But it is possible, O
bhikkhus, it is to be found, that a certain being from that group, having
passed away, comes to this state of existence. Having come to this state of
existence, he is one who goes forth from the house [life] into
homelessness. Being one who has gone forth from the house [life] into
homelessness, in consequence of ardour, in consequence of endeavour, in
consequence of application, in consequence of vigilance, in consequence of
right attention, he mentally touches such a form of samadhi where in that
state of mind, he recollects his former abode, [but apart] from there, he
does not recollect others. He says thus: “Those honorable devas who are
not amusement revelers, they do not dwell excessively engaged in the habit
of laughter and enjoyment. For those not dwelling excessively engaged in the
habit of laughter and enjoyment, their mindfulness is not muddled. With
mindfulness not muddled, those devas do not pass away from that group. They
are permanent, stable, eternal, not liable to change. They just remain thus
forever and ever. However, we who were amusement revelers, dwelling
excessively engaged in the habit of laughter and enjoyment, [our]
mindfulness became muddled. With muddled mindfulness we passed away from
that group. We are impermanent, unstable, short lived, liable to fall away
and come to this state of existence.” This, O bhikkhus, is the
second ground owing to which, having regard for which some samanas and
brahmanas who are partial eternal and partial non-eternal theorizers declare
the self and the world to be partially eternal and partially non-eternal.

<p><span class="parno">48</span>
And in the third place, owing to what, having regard for what, [do] those
honorable samanas and brahmanas who are partial eternal and partial
non-eternal theorizers, declare the self and the world [to be] partially
eternal and partially non-eternal? There are, O bhikkhus, devas named
corrupted in mind. They excessively reflect upon one another. Those
excessively reflecting upon one another, they cause to corrupt one another's
minds. Those who corrupt one another's minds, their bodies become tired and
their minds become tired. Those devas pass away from that group. But it is
possible, O bhikkhus, it is to be found, that a certain being from that
group, having passed away, comes to this state of existence. Having come to
this state of existence, he is one who goes forth from the house [life] into
homelessness. Being one who has gone forth from the house [life] into
homelessness, in consequence of ardour, in consequence of endeavour, in
consequence of application, in consequence of vigilance, in consequence of
right attention, he mentally touches such a form of samadhi where in that
state of mind, he recollects his former abode, [but apart] from there, he
does not recollect others. He says thus: “Those honorable devas who are
not corrupted in mind, they do not excessively reflect upon one
another. Those not excessively reflecting upon one another, they do not
cause to corrupt one another's minds. Those who do not corrupt one another's
minds, their bodies do not become tired and their minds do not become
tired. Those devas do not pass away from that group. They are permanent,
stable, eternal, not liable to change. They just remain thus forever and
ever. However, we who were corrupted in mind, we excessively reflected upon
one another. Excessively reflecting upon one another, we caused to corrupt
one another's minds. We who corrupted one another's minds, our bodies became
tired and our minds became tired. We passed away from that group. We are
impermanent, unstable, short lived, liable to fall away and come to this
state of existence.” This, O bhikkhus, is the third ground owing to
which, having regard for which some samanas and brahmanas who are partial
eternal and partial non-eternal theorizers declare the self and the world to
be partially eternal and partially non-eternal.

<p><span class="parno">49</span>
And in the fourth place, owing to what, having regard for what, [do] those
honorable samanas and brahmanas who are partial eternal and partial
non-eternal theorizers, declare the self and the world [to be] partially
eternal and partially non-eternal? Here, O bhikkhus, a certain samana or
brahmana is a logician, an investigator. Having hammered out by
argumentations accompanied by investigation according to his own
intelligence, he says thus: “That which is said to be this: the eyes, the
ears too, the nose too, the tongue too, the body too,” this self is
impermanent, unstable, not eternal, liable to change. “And that which is
the mental or the mind or consciousness, this self is permanent, stable,
eternal, not liable to change. It just remains thus forever and
ever.” This, O bhikkhus, is the fourth ground owing to which,
having regard for which some samanas and brahmanas who are partial eternal
and partial non-eternal theorizers declare the self and the world to be
partially eternal and partially non-eternal.

<p><span class="parno">50</span>
Indeed, it is these, O bhikkhus, by which those samanas and brahmanas whose

There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas who are finite or infinite
world theorists, who declare the world to be finite or infinite from four
grounds. Owing to what, having regard for what, [do] those honorable samanas
and brahmanas declare the self and the world [to be] finite or infinite by
four grounds?

<p><span class="parno">54</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain samana or brahmana, in consequence of ardour, in
consequence of endeavour, in consequence of application, in consequence of
vigilance, in consequence of right attention, mentally touches such a form
of samadhi where in that state of mind, he abides percipient of the world as
finite. He says thus: “This world is finite and bounded. What is the
reason for that? Because I, in consequence of ardour, in consequence of
endeavour, in consequence of application, in consequence of vigilance, in
consequence of right attention, mentally touch such a form of samadhi where
in that state of mind, I abide percipient of the world as finite. In this
way I understand just how this world is finite and bounded.” This,

That, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata understands this: “These standpoint for
views, thus welcome, thus held on to, thus grasped, they will lead to such
after death state.” And that the Tathagata understands what
transcends that understanding, and not being attached to that understanding,
and not holding to it, he has just known personal extinguishing by final
knowledge. And having known as they have come to be the arising, the
extinction, the gratification, the liability and the stepping out of
feelings, not having appropriated, the Tathagata, O bhikkhus, is liberated.

<p><span class="parno">60</span>
These, O bhikkhus, are those dhammas that are deep, difficult to see,
difficult to awaken to, peaceful, excellent, not within the sphere of
reasoning, subtle, to be directly experienced by the wise, which the
Tathagata, having realized by himself with higher knowledge, causes to make
them known, by which those who rightly speak in praise of the Tathagata in
conformity with the truth might say.

<p><span class="parno">61</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas who give evasive answers
[when] so and so questions are brought up. They set about confusing
statements and endless equivocation by four grounds. Owing to what, having
regard for what, [do] those honorable samanas and brahmanas give evasive
answers [when] so and so questions are brought up, and set about confusing
statements and endless equivocation by four grounds?

<p><span class="parno">62</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain samana or brahmana does not understand as it has
come to be, “this is wholesome.” He does not understand as it
has come to be, “this is unwholesome.” It occurs to him thus:
“I do not understand as it has come to be, “this is
wholesome.” I do not understand as it has come to be, “this is
unwholesome.” But [if] I, simply not understanding as it has come
to be, “this is wholesome,” not understanding as it has come to
be, “this is unwholesome,” were to declare: “This is
wholesome” or were to declare: “This is unwholesome,”
there might be a desire or lust or hate or aversion for me therein. Wherein
there might be a desire or lust or hate or aversion for me, that is a lie of
mine. That which is a lie of mine, that is a vexation for me. That which is
a vexation for me, that is an obstacle for me.” Thus, for fear of
speaking a lie, disgust with speaking a lie, he neither declares: “This
is wholesome,” and yet nor declares: “This is
unwholesome.” [When] so and so question is asked, he sets about
confusing statements and endless equivocation: Thus, is not [declared] by
me. “Just so” too, is not [declared] by
me. “Otherwise” too, is not [declared] by me. “Not
so” too, is not [declared] by me. “Not not so” too, is
not [declared] by me.” This, O bhikkhus is the first ground, owing
to which, having regard for which some honorable samanas and brahmanas give
evasive answers [when] so and so questions are brought up, and set about
confusing statements and endless equivocation.

<p><span class="parno">63</span>
And in the second place, owing to what, having regard for what, [do] those
honorable samanas and brahmanas give evasive answers [when] so and so
questions are brought up, and set about confusing statements and endless
equivocation? Here, O bhikkhus, a certain samana or brahmana does not
understand as it has come to be, “this is wholesome.” He does
not understand as it has come to be, “this is unwholesome.” It
occurs to him thus: “I do not understand as it has come to be, “this
is wholesome.” I do not understand as it has come to be, “this
is unwholesome.” But [if] I, simply not understanding as it has
come to be, “this is wholesome,” not understanding as it has
come to be, “this is unwholesome,” were to declare: “This is
wholesome” or were to declare: “This is unwholesome,”
there might be a desire or lust or hate or aversion for me therein. Wherein
there might be a desire or lust or hate or aversion for me, that is holding
of mine. That which is a holding of mine, that is a vexation for me. That
which is a vexation for me, that is an obstacle for me.” Thus, for
fear of holding, disgust with holding, he neither declares: “This is
wholesome,” and yet nor declares: “This is
unwholesome.” [When] so and so question is asked, he sets about
confusing statements and endless equivocation: Thus, is not [declared] by
me. “Just so” too, is not [declared] by
me. “Otherwise” too, is not [declared] by me. “Not
so” too, is not [declared] by me. “Not not so” too, is
not [declared] by me.” This, O bhikkhus is the second ground, owing
to which, having regard for which some honorable samanas and brahmanas give
evasive answers [when] so and so questions are brought up, and set about
confusing statements and endless equivocation.

<p><span class="parno">64</span>
And in the third place, owing to what, having regard for what, [do] those
honorable samanas and brahmanas give evasive answers [when] so and so
questions are brought up, and set about confusing statements and endless
equivocation? Here, O bhikkhus, a certain samana or brahmana does not
understand as it has come to be, “this is wholesome.” He does
not understand as it has come to be, “this is unwholesome.” It
occurs to him thus: “I do not understand as it has come to be, “this
is wholesome.” I do not understand as it has come to be, “this
is unwholesome.” But [if] I, simply not understanding as it has
come to be, “this is wholesome,” not understanding as it has
come to be, “this is unwholesome,” were to declare: “This is
wholesome” or were to declare: “This is unwholesome,”
there are indeed samanas and brahmanas who are ever so wise, clever,
accomplished in other's doctrines. One would think they roam about splitting
by wisdom [the views of] those who are well-settled in views, like archers
who can split hairs. [We] might converse together, those might cross
question me, therein might asks for reasons, of those I might not be able to
explain. Of which I might not be able to explain, that is a vexation for
me. That which is a vexation for me, that is an obstacle for me.”
Thus, for fear of inquiry, disgust with inquiry, he neither declares:
“This is wholesome,” and yet nor declares: “This is
unwholesome.” [When] so and so question is asked, he sets about
confusing statements and endless equivocation: Thus, is not [declared] by
me. “Just so” too, is not [declared] by
me. “Otherwise” too, is not [declared] by me. “Not
so” too, is not [declared] by me. “Not not so” too, is
not [declared] by me.” This, O bhikkhus is the third ground, owing
to which, having regard for which some honorable samanas and brahmanas give
evasive answers [when] so and so questions are brought up, and set about
confusing statements and endless equivocation.

<p><span class="parno">65</span>
And in the fourth place, owing to what, having regard for what, [do] those
honorable samanas and brahmanas give evasive answers [when] so and so
questions are brought up, and set about confusing statements and endless
equivocation? Here, O bhikkhus, a certain samana or brahmana is stupid and
dull. [Due to] his stupidity and dullness, [when] so and so question is
asked, he sets about confusing statements and endless equivocation: “Is
there another world?” If you ask of me thus, if of me thus
[occurs]: “There is another world,” “there is another
world,” would be declared for you thus. [But] thus, is not
[declared] by me. “Just so” too, is not [declared] by
me. “Otherwise” too, is not [declared] by me. “Not
so” too, is not [declared] by me. “Not not so” too, is
not [declared] by me.” “Is there not another world?” If
you ask of me thus, if of me thus [occurs]: “There is not another

for you thus. [But] thus, is not [declared] by me. “Just so”
too, is not [declared] by me. “Otherwise” too, is not [declared]
by me. “Not so” too, is not [declared] by me. “Not not
so” too, is not [declared] by me.” “Is there both
another world and not another world?” If you ask of me thus, if of
me thus [occurs]: “There is both another world and not another

another world?” If you ask of me thus, if of me thus [occurs]:
“There is neither another world nor not another world,”
“there is neither another world nor not another world,” would be
declared for you thus. [But] thus, is not [declared] by me. “Just
so” too, is not [declared] by me. “Otherwise” too, is
not [declared] by me. “Not so” too, is not [declared] by
me. “Not not so” too, is not [declared] by me.” “Are
there beings born spontaneously?” If you ask of me thus, if of me
thus [occurs]: “There are beings born spontaneously,” “There
are beings born spontaneously,” would be declared for you
thus. [But] thus, is not [declared] by me. “Just so” too, is not
[declared] by me. “Otherwise” too, is not [declared] by
me. “Not so” too, is not [declared] by me. “Not not

thus, if of me thus [occurs]: “There are neither beings born

spontaneously,” would be declared for you thus. [But] thus, is not

me. “Otherwise” too, is not [declared] by me. “Not
so” too, is not [declared] by me. “Not not so” too, is

of what is well done and badly done?” If you ask of me thus, if of
me thus [occurs]: “There are fruits and results of kamma, of what is well
done and badly done,” “There are fruits and results of kamma, of
what is well done and badly done,” would be declared for you
thus. [But] thus, is not [declared] by me. “Just so” too, is not

If you ask of me thus, if of me thus [occurs]: “There are not fruits and

to which, having regard for which some honorable samanas and brahmanas give
evasive answers [when] so and so questions are brought up, and set about
confusing statements and endless equivocation.

<p><span class="parno">66</span>
Indeed, it is these, O bhikkhus, by which those samanas and brahmanas who
give evasive answers [when] so and so questions are brought up, set about
confusing statements and endless equivocation by four grounds. Indeed, O
bhikkhus, whichever samanas or brahmanas give evasive answers [when] so and
so questions are brought up and set about confusing statements and endless
equivocation, all those [do so] by only these four grounds or by a certain
one [among] these. Aside from these there is none.

<p><span class="parno">67</span>
That, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata understands this: “These standpoint for
views, thus welcome, thus held on to, thus grasped, they will lead to such
after death state.” And that the Tathagata understands what
transcends that understanding, and not being attached to that understanding,
and not holding to it, he has just known personal extinguishing by final
knowledge. And having known as they have come to be the arising, the
extinction, the gratification, the liability and the stepping out of
feelings, not having appropriated, the Tathagata, O bhikkhus, is liberated.

<p><span class="parno">68</span>
These, O bhikkhus, are those dhammas that are deep, difficult to see,
difficult to awaken to, peaceful, excellent, not within the sphere of
reasoning, subtle, to be directly experienced by the wise, which the
Tathagata, having realized by himself with higher knowledge, causes to make
them known, by which those who rightly speak in praise of the Tathagata in
conformity with the truth might say.

<p><span class="parno">69</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas who are fortuitous
origination theorists, who declare the self and the world to have originated
fortuitously by two grounds. Owing to what, having regard for what, do those
honorable samanas and brahmanas who are fortuitous origination theorists,
declare the self and the world to have originated fortuitously by two
grounds?

<p><span class="parno">70</span>
There are indeed, O bhikkhus, devas who are non-percipient beings. However,
those devas pass away from that group upon the coming into existence of
perception. But it is possible, O bhikkhus, it is to be found, that a
certain being, having passed away from that group, comes to this state of
existence. Having come to this state of existence, he is one who goes forth
from the house [life] into homelessness. Being one who has gone forth from
the house [life] into homelessness, in consequence of ardour, in consequence
of endeavour, in consequence of application, in consequence of vigilance, in
consequence of right attention, he mentally touches such a form of samadhi
where in that state of mind, he recollects his former abode [but apart] from
there, he does not recollect others. He says thus: “The self and the
world have arisen without a cause. What is the reason for that? Because
formerly, I was not. At present, I am. Not having been, [I] was transformed
into the state of having existence.” This, O bhikkhus, is the first
ground owing to which, having regard for which some samanas and brahmanas
declare the self and the world to have originated fortuitously.

<p><span class="parno">71</span>
And in the second place, owing to what, having regard for what, [do] those
honorable samanas and brahmanas who are fortuitous origination theorists,
declare the self and the world to have originated fortuitously. Here, O
bhikkhus, a certain samana or brahmana is a logician, an
investigator. Having hammered out by argumentations accompanied by
investigation according to his own intelligence, he says thus: “The self
and the world have arisen without a cause.” This, O bhikkhus, is
the second ground owing to which, having regard for which some samanas and
brahmanas declare the self and the world to have originated fortuitously.

<p><span class="parno">72</span>
Indeed, it is these, O bhikkhus, by which those samanas and brahmanas who
are fortuitous origination theorists, declare the self and the world to have
originated fortuitously by two grounds. Indeed, O bhikkhus, whichever
samanas or brahmanas are fortuitous origination theorists, declare the self
and the world to have originated fortuitously, all those [do so] by only
these two grounds or by a certain one [among] these. Aside from these there
is none.

<p><span class="parno">73</span>
That, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata understands this: “These standpoint for

<p><span class="parno">75</span>
Indeed, it is these, O bhikkhus, by which those samanas and brahmanas who
are past world-cycle theorists, who [hold] views in line with the past,
assert various theories concerning the past by these eighteen
grounds. Indeed, O bhikkhus, whichever samanas or brahmanas are past
world-cycle theorists, who [hold] views in line with the past, assert
various theories concerning the past, all those [do so] by only these
eighteen grounds or by a certain one [among] these. Aside from these there
is none.

<p><span class="parno">76</span>

<p><span class="parno">78</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas who are future world-cycle
theorizers, who [hold] views in line with the future, who assert various
theories concerning the future by these forty four grounds. Owing to what,
having regard for what, do those honorable samanas and brahmanas who are
future world-cycle theorizers, who [hold] views in line with the future,
assert various theories concerning the future by these forty four grounds?

<p><span class="parno">79</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas who are immortality after
death theorizers, whose teaching is percipient [immortality], who declare
the self to be immortal and percipient after death by sixteen grounds. Owing
to what, having regard for what, do those honorable samanas and brahmanas
who are immortality after death theorizers, whose teaching is percipient
[immortality], declare the self to be immortal and percipient after death by
sixteen grounds?

<p><span class="parno">80</span>
They declare: “The self is possessed of form, percipient and free from
sickness after death.” They declare: “The self is formless,
percipient and free from sickness after death.” They declare:
“The self is [both] possessed of form and formless, percipient and free
from sickness after death.” They declare: “The self is neither
possessed of form nor formless, percipient and free from sickness after
death.” They declare: “The self is finite, percipient and free

percipient and free from sickness after death.” They declare:
“The self is both finite and infinite, percipient and free from sickness
after death.” They declare: “The self is neither finite nor
infinite, percipient and free from sickness after death.” They
declare: “The self is of unified perception and free from sickness after
death.” They declare: “The self is of diversified perception and
free from sickness after death.” They declare: “The self is of
limited perception and free from sickness after death.” They
declare: “The self is of boundless perception and free from sickness
after death.” They declare: “The self is percipient of only
pleasure and free from sickness after death.” They declare: “The
self is percipient of only pain and free from sickness after
death.” They declare: “The self is percipient of both pleasure
and pain and free from sickness after death.” They declare: “The
self is percipient of neither pleasure nor pain and free from sickness after
death.”

<p><span class="parno">81</span>
Indeed, it is these, O bhikkhus, by which those samanas and brahmanas who

sixteen grounds. Indeed, O bhikkhus, whichever samanas or brahmanas are

<p><span class="parno">89</span>
There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas who are immortality after
death theorizers, whose teaching is neither percipient nor non-percipient
[immortality], who declare the self to be immortal and neither percipient
nor non-percipient after death by eight grounds. Owing to what, having
regard for what, do those honorable samanas and brahmanas who are
immortality after death theorizers, whose teaching is neither percipient nor
non-percipient [immortality], declare the self to be immortal and
non-percipient after death by eight grounds?

<p><span class="parno">90</span>
They declare: “The self is possessed of form, neither percipient nor
non-percipient and free from sickness after death.” They declare:
“The self is formless, neither percipient nor non-percipient and free
from sickness after death.” They declare: “The self is [both]
possessed of form and formless, neither percipient nor non-percipient and
free from sickness after death.” They declare: “The self is
neither possessed of form nor formless, neither percipient nor
non-percipient and free from sickness after death.” They declare:
“The self is finite, neither percipient nor non-percipient and free from
sickness after death.” They declare: “The self is infinite,
neither percipient nor non-percipient and free from sickness after
death.” They declare: “The self is both finite and infinite,
neither percipient nor non-percipient and free from sickness after
death.” They declare: “The self is neither finite nor infinite,
neither percipient nor non-percipient and free from sickness after
death.”

<p><span class="parno">91</span>
Indeed, it is these, O bhikkhus, by which those samanas and brahmanas who
are immortality after death theorizers, whose teaching is neither percipient
nor non-percipient [immortality], declare the self to be immortal and
neither percipient nor non-percipient after death by eight grounds. Indeed,
O bhikkhus, whichever samanas or brahmanas are immortality after death
theorizers, whose teaching is neither percipient nor non-percipient
[immortality], declare the self to be immortal and neither percipient nor
non-percipient after death, all those [do so] by only these eight grounds or
by a certain one [among] these. Aside from these there is none.

That, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata understands this: “These standpoint for
views, thus welcome, thus held on to, thus grasped, they will lead to such
after death state.” And that the Tathagata understands what
transcends that understanding, and not being attached to that understanding,
and not holding to it, he has just known personal extinguishing by final
knowledge. And having known as they have come to be the arising, the
extinction, the gratification, the liability and the stepping out of
feelings, not having appropriated, the Tathagata, O bhikkhus, is liberated.

<p><span class="parno">93</span>
These, O bhikkhus, are those dhammas that are deep, difficult to see,
difficult to awaken to, peaceful, excellent, not within the sphere of
reasoning, subtle, to be directly experienced by the wise, which the
Tathagata, having realized by himself with higher knowledge, causes to make
them known, by which those who rightly speak in praise of the Tathagata in
conformity with the truth might say.

There are, O bhikkhus, some samanas and brahmanas whose teaching is the
annihilation of an existing being, who declare the annihilation,
destruction, non-being by seven grounds. Owing to what, having regard for

annihilation of an existing being, declare the annihilation, destruction,

<p><span class="parno">95</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain samana or brahmana is of such doctrine, such
view: “Really, Sir, since this self, possessed of form, [composed] of the
four great elements, originating from father and mother, at the break up of
the body, will be annihilated, destroyed and does not exist after death, it
is really to this extent, sir, that this self is rightly
well-annihilated.” In this way, some declare the annihilation,
destruction, non-being of an existing being.

<p><span class="parno">96</span>
To him, another says thus: “Sir, there exists that self which you speak
of. I do not say it does not exist. But sir, it is not to this extend that
this self is rightly well-annihilated. Sir, there exists another self which
is divine, possessed of form, belonging to the sensual realm, subsisting on
food taking in lumps. You don't know it, you don't see it. I know it, I see
it. Sir, since, with the breakup of the body, that self becomes annihilated
and destroyed and does not exist after death, it is to this extend, sir,
that this self is rightly well-annihilated.” In this way, some
declare the annihilation, destruction, non-being of an existing being.

<p><span class="parno">97</span>
To him, another says thus: “Sir, there exists that self which you speak

complete in all its parts. You don't know it, you don't see it. I know it, I

from the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, from the extinguishing
of perceptions of resistance, from non-attention to perceptions of
diversity, “space is infinite,” reaches the domain of infinite
space. You don't know it, you don't see it. I know it, I see it. Sir, since,

<p><span class="parno">102</span>
Indeed, it is these, O bhikkhus, by which those samanas and brahmanas whose

<p><span class="parno">106</span>
Here, O bhikkhus, a certain samana or brahmana is of such doctrine, such
view: “Really, sir, from the time this self, causes to amuse itself
furnished and provided with the five cords of sensual pleasure, it is to
this extend, sir, that this self has attained supreme nibbana in this
life.” In this way, some declare the supreme nibbana of an existing
being in this life.

<p><span class="parno">107</span>
To him, another says thus: “Sir, there exists that self which you speak
of. I do not say it does not exist.” But sir, it is not to this
extend that this self attains supreme nibbana in this life. What is the
reason for that? Because sir, sensual pleasures are impermanent, suffering
and liable to change. Their changing and becoming otherwise give rise to
sorrow, lamentation, physical suffering, mental suffering and despair. Sir,
from the time this self, quite secluded from sense-desires, secluded from
unwholesome dhammas, enters upon and abides in the rapture and pleasure born
of seclusion connected with thinking and pondering, the first jhana, it is
to this extend, sir, that this self has attained supreme nibbana in this
life.” In this way, some declare the supreme nibbana of an existing
being in this life.

<p><span class="parno">108</span>
To him, another says thus: “Sir, there exists that self which you speak

that is declared coarse. “Sir, from the time this self, from the
subsiding of thinking and pondering, with the internal tranquilization and
unification of mind [due to] the absence of thinking and pondering, enters
upon and abides in the rapture and pleasure born of samadhi, the second
jhana, it is to this extend, sir, that this self has attained supreme
nibbana in this life.” In this way, some declare the supreme

To him, another says thus: “Sir, there exists that self which you speak

rapture therein, that is declared coarse. “Sir, from the time that with
detachment from rapture, dwelling mindful and clearly comprehending, this
self [while] looking on with equanimity experiences pleasure in the body, of
which the Noble Ones say: “He is a mindful one who [looks on with]
equanimity, one who dwells in pleasure,” enters upon and abides in
the third jhana, it is to this extend, sir, that this self has attained
supreme nibbana in this life.” In this way, some declare the
supreme nibbana of an existing being in this life.

<p><span class="parno">110</span>
To him, another says thus: “Sir, there exists that self which you speak

pleasure” therein, that is declared coarse. “Sir, from the time
this self, from the abandoning of [physical] pleasure and pain, from the
extinction of former mental pleasure and mental pain, enters upon and abides
in the utter purity of mindfulness and equanimity without pain and pleasure,
the fourth jhana, it is to this extend, sir, that this self has attained

<p><span class="parno">145</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those samanas and brahmanas whose teaching is the
annihilation of an existing being, who declare the annihilation,
destruction, non-being by seven grounds, “indeed, that they will

<p><span class="parno">146</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those samanas and brahmanas whose teaching is nibbana
in this life, who declare the supreme nibbana of an existing being in this
life by five grounds, “indeed, that they will experience apart from

<p><span class="parno">147</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those samanas and brahmanas who are future world-cycle
theorizers, who [hold] views in line with the future, who assert various
theories concerning future by these forty four grounds, “indeed, that
they will experience apart from contact,” this possibility is not

<p><span class="parno">148</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those samanas and brahmanas who are past world-cycle

<p><span class="parno">149</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those samanas and brahmanas whose teaching is
eternalism, who declare the self and the world to be eternal by four
grounds, also those samanas and brahmanas who are partial eternal and
partial non-eternal theorizers, also those samanas and brahmanas who are
finite or infinite world theorizers, also those samanas and brahmanas who
give evasive answers, when so and so questions are brought up, also those
samanas and brahmanas who assert that things originate fortuitously, also
those samanas and brahmanas who are immortality after death theorizers,
whose teaching is percipient [immortality], also those samanas and brahmanas
who are immortality after death theorizers, whose teaching is non-percipient

annihilation of an existing being, also those samanas and brahmanas whose
teaching is nibbana in this life, also those samanas and brahmanas who are
future world-cycle theorizers, also those samanas and brahmanas who are past
world-cycle theorizers and future world-cycle theorizers, who [hold] views
in line with the past and future, who assert various theories concerning the
past and future by these sixty-two grounds, all those are caused to
experience by contacting again and again the six domains of contact. In
dependence on feeling, thirst comes to be. In dependence on thirst, holding
comes to be. In dependence on holding, being comes to be. In dependence on
being, birth comes to be. In dependence on birth, old age and death, sorrow,
lamentation, physical suffering, mental suffering and despair arise. From
when, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu wisely understands the arising, the extinction,
the gratification, the liability and the stepping out of the six domains for
contact as it has come to be, he wisely understands what simply transcends
all these [views].

<p><span class="parno">150</span>
Indeed, O bhikkhus, whichever samanas or brahmanas are past world-cycle
theorizers or future world-cycle theorizers or past and future world-cycle
theorizers, who [hold] views in line with the past and the future, assert
various theories concerning the past and the future, all those are caught in
the net of just these sixty-two grounds. Emerging, they emerge certainly
trapped here. Emerging, they emerge certainly caught in the net, included
within [the net] here. Just as, O bhikkhus, a skilled fisherman or
fisherman's apprentice might spread a fine-mesh net over a small pool of
water, whichever of those large living beings are in this pool of water, all
those emerging emerge caught in the net, certainly trapped here, emerging,
they emerge certainly caught in the net, included within [the net] here, it
is really just so, O bhikkhus, whichever samanas or brahmanas are past
world-cycle theorizers or future world-cycle theorizers or past and future
world-cycle theorizers, who [hold] views in line with the past and the
future, who assert various theories concerning the past and the future, all
those are caught in the net of just these sixty-two grounds. Emerging, they
emerge certainly trapped here. Emerging, they emerge certainly caught in the
net, included within [the net] here.

The body of the Tathagata stands, O bhikkhus, with the conduit to being
cut. For as long as the body remains, for that long, devas and humans [will]
see him. With the breakup of the body, after the exhaustion of life, devas
and humans [will] see him no longer.

“Just as, O bhikkhus, when a bunch of mangoes on a stalk is cut, that
which is the mango fruit bound to the stalk, all those follow, it is really
just so, O bhikkhus, the body of the Tathagata stands with the conduit to
being cut. For as long as the body remains, for that long, devas and humans
[will] see him. With the breakup of the body, after the exhaustion of life,
devas and humans [will] see him no longer.”

When thus was said, the venerable Ananda said this to the Auspicious One:
“It is marvellous, O Bhante. It is unprecedented, O Bhante. What is the
name of this dhamma discourse, O Bhante?” “Well then, O Ananda,
you bear in mind this Dhamma discourse as the net of meaning; also bear it
in mind as the net of Dhamma; also bear it in mind as the net of Brahma;
also bear it in mind as the net of views; also bear it in mind as the
unsurpassed victory in battle.”

<p><span class="parno">153</span>
This is what the Auspicious One said. Delighted, those bhikkhus rejoiced in
the Auspicious One's words. “And while this exposition was being
expounded, the ten thousand world system quaked.”
