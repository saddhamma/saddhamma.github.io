Those ascetics and brahmins, O bhikkhus, who are past world cycle
theorizers, future world cycle theorizers, and past and future world cycle
theorizers, who [hold] views in line with the past and the future, they
assert various theories concerning the past and the future from these
sixty-two grounds. Indeed, O bhikkhus, whichever ascetics or brahmins or
past world cycle theorizers, and future world cycle theorizers, and past and
future world cycle theorizers, who [hold] views in line with the past and
the future, who assert various theories concerning the past and the future,
all those [do so] only from these sixty-two grounds, or a certain one [among
them]. Apart from this there is none.

<p><span class="parno">106</span>
That, O bhikkhus, the Tathagata wisely understands this: “These
standpoint for views, thus welcome, thus held on to, thus grasped, they will
lead to such after death state.” And that the Tathagata wisely
understands what transcends that understanding, and not being attached to
that understanding, and not holding to it, he has simply known personal
extinguishing by final knowledge. And having known the arising, and the
extinction, and the gratification, and the liability and the stepping out of
feelings as it has come to be, the Tathagata, O bhikkhus, is liberated
through not holding.

<p><span class="parno">107</span>
These, O bhikkhus, are really those dhammas that are deep, difficult to see,
difficult to awaken to, peaceful, most excellent, not within the sphere of
reasoning, subtle, to be directly experienced by the wise, which the
Tathagata, having realized by himself with higher knowledge, causes to make
it known. Those who rightly speak in praise of the Tathagata in conformity
with the truth would say this.

<p><span class="parno">108</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who are eternalists, who
declare the self and the world to be eternal from four grounds, that too is
only the feeling of agitation and vacillation of those honourable recluses
and brahmins who, not knowing, not seeing, are well-settled in craving.

<p><span class="parno">109</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who are partial
eternalists, and partial non-eternalists, who declare the self and the world
to be partial non-eternal from four grounds, that too is only the feeling of
agitation and vacillation of those honourable recluses and brahmins who, not
knowing, not seeing, are well-settled in craving.

<p><span class="parno">110</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who are [both] finite and
infinite world theorizers, who declare the world to be finite and infinite
from four grounds, that too is only the feeling of agitation and vacillation
of those honourable recluses and brahmins who, not knowing, not seeing, are
well-settled in craving.

<p><span class="parno">111</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who give evasive answers
when so and so questions are brought up, who resort to confusing statements,
who get into endless equivocation from four grounds, that too is only the
feeling of agitation and vacillation of those honourable recluses and
brahmins who, not knowing, not seeing, are well-settled in craving.

<p><span class="parno">112</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who assert that things
originate fortuitously, who declare the self and the world to be
fortuitously originated from two grounds, that too is only the feeling of

knowing, not seeing, are well-settled in craving.

<p><span class="parno">113</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who are past world cycle

brahmins who, not knowing, not seeing, are well-settled in craving.

of conscious existence after death, who declare the self to be existence and

<p><span class="parno">115</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who believe in the doctrine
of non-conscious existence after death, who declare the self to be existence
and non-percipient after death from eight grounds, that too is only the
feeling of agitation and vacillation of those honourable recluses and
brahmins who, not knowing, not seeing, are well-settled in craving.

<p><span class="parno">116</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who believe in the doctrine
of neither percipient nor non-percipient existence after death, who declare
the self to be existence and neither percipient nor non-percipient after
death from eight grounds, that too is only the feeling of agitation and
vacillation of those honourable recluses and brahmins who, not knowing, not
seeing, are well-settled in craving.

<p><span class="parno">117</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who believe in the doctrine
of annihilation of existing being, who declare the annihilation,
destruction, non-being of a being from seven grounds, that too is only the
feeling of agitation and vacillation of those honourable recluses and
brahmins who, not knowing, not seeing, are well-settled in craving.

<p><span class="parno">118</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who believe in the doctrine
of nibbana in this life for an existing being, who declare supreme nibbana
from five grounds, that too is only the feeling of agitation and vacillation
of those honourable recluses and brahmins who, not knowing, not seeing, are
well-settled in craving.

<p><span class="parno">119</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who are future world cycle
theorizers, who [hold] views in line with the future, who assert various
theories concerning the future from these forty four grounds, that too is
only the feeling of agitation and vacillation of those honourable recluses
and brahmins who, not knowing, not seeing, are well-settled in craving.

<p><span class="parno">120</span>

<p><span class="parno">147</span>
Therein, O bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who are eternalists, who
declare the self and the world to be eternal from four grounds, also those
ascetics and brahmins who are partial eternalists, and partial
non-eternalists, also those ascetics and brahmins who are [both] finite and
infinite world theorizers, also those ascetics and brahmins who give evasive
answers, when so and so questions are brought up, also those ascetics and
brahmins who assert that things originate fortuitously, also those ascetics

also those ascetics and brahmins who believe in the doctrine of
non-conscious existence after death, also those ascetics and brahmins who

ascetics and brahmins who are past world cycle theorizers and future world
cycle theorizers, who [hold] views in line with the past and future, who
assert various theories concerning the past and future, from these sixty-two
grounds, all those are caused to experience [feeling] by contacting again
and again the six domains of contact. In dependence on feeling, thirst comes
to be. In dependence on thirst, holding comes to be. In dependence on
holding, being comes to be. In dependence on being, birth comes to be. In
dependence on birth, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, physical
suffering, mental suffering and despair arise. From when, O bhikkhus, a
bhikkhu wisely understands the arising, the extinction, the gratification,
the liability and the stepping out of the six bases of contact as it has
come to be, he wisely understands what simply transcends all these [views].

<p><span class="parno">148</span>
Indeed, O bhikkhus, whichever ascetics or brahmins or past world cycle
theorizers or future world cycle theorizers or past and future world cycle
theorizers, who [hold] views in line with the past and the future, who
assert various theories concerning the past and the future, all those are
caught in the net of just these sixty-two grounds. Emerging, they emerge
certainly trapped here. Emerging, they emerge certainly caught in the net,
included within [the net] here. Just as, O bhikkhus, a skilled fisherman or
fisherman's apprentice might spread a fine-mesh net over a small pool of
water, whichever of those large living beings are in this pool of water, all
those emerging emerge caught in the net, certainly trapped here, emerging,
they emerge certainly caught in the net, included within [the net] here, it
is really just so, O bhikkhus, whichever ascetics or brahmins or past world
cycle theorizers or future world cycle theorizers or past and future world
cycle theorizers, who [hold] views in line with the past and the future, who
assert various theories concerning the past and the future, all those are
caught in the net of just these sixty-two grounds. Emerging, they emerge
certainly trapped here. Emerging, they emerge certainly caught in the net,
included within [the net] here.

<p><span class="parno">149</span>
The body of the Tathagata stands, O bhikkhus, with the conduit to being
cut. For as long as the body remains, for that long, devas and humans [will]
see him. With the breakup of the body, after the exhaustion of life, devas
and humans [will] see him no longer.

“Just as, O bhikkhus, when a bunch of mangoes on a stalk is cut, that
which is the mango fruit bound to the stalk, all those follow, it is really
just so, O bhikkhus, the body of the Tathagata stands with the conduit to
being cut. For as long as the body remains, for that long, devas and humans
[will] see him. With the breakup of the body, after the exhaustion of life,
devas and humans [will] see him no longer.”

<p><span class="parno">150</span>
When thus was said, the venerable Ananda said this to the Auspicious One:
“It is marvellous, O Bhante. It is unprecedented, O Bhante. What is the
name of this dhamma discourse, O Bhante?” “Well then, O Ananda,
you bear in mind this Dhamma discourse as the net of meaning; also bear it
in mind as the net of Dhamma; also bear it in mind as the net of Brahma;
also bear it in mind as the net of views; also bear it in mind as the
unsurpassed victory in battle.”

<p><span class="parno">151</span>
This is what the Auspicious One said. Delighted, those bhikkhus rejoiced in
the Auspicious One's words. “And while this exposition was being
expounded, the ten thousand world system quaked.”
