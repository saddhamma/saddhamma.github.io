<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One entered upon the high
road between Rajagaha and Nalanda with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with
about five hundred bhikkhus. Suppiya, the wanderer, had also entered upon
the high road between Rajagaha and Nalanda with his pupil, the brahmin youth
Brahmadatta. There, Suppiya the wanderer, in various ways, only spoke in
dispraise of the Buddha, spoke in dispraise of the Dhamma, spoke in
dispraise of the Sangha. However, Suppiya, the wanderer's pupil, the brahmin
youth Brahmadatta, in various ways, spoke in praise of the Buddha, spoke in
praise of the Dhamma, spoke in praise of the Sangha. Thus indeed, both
teacher and pupil spoke directly opposing one another as they followed
behind the Auspicious One and the Bhikkhu Sangha.

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Later on, the Auspicious One entered the King's Cottage at Ambalatthika with
the Bhikkhu Sangha to spend one night. Suppiya, the wanderer also entered
the King's Cottage at Ambalatthika with his pupil, brahmin youth
Brahmadatta, to spend one night. There too, Suppiya the wanderer, in various
ways, only spoke in dispraise of the Buddha, spoke in dispraise of the
Dhamma, spoke in dispraise of the Sangha. However, Suppiya, the wandering
ascetic's pupil, the brahmin youth Brahmadatta, in various ways, spoke in
praise of the Buddha, spoke in praise of the Dhamma, spoke in praise of the
Sangha. Thus indeed, both teacher and pupil spoke directly opposing one
another as the dwelled.

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Then, as the night [turned to] early morning, many bhikkhus having arisen,
having assembled at the round pavilion, this topic of conversation arose as
they settled: “It is marvellous, O friends. It is unprecedented, O
friends, in so far as the Auspicious One who knows and sees, the Arahant,
the rightly self-awakened One, has well known the diverse dispositions of
beings. Indeed, this Suppiya the wanderer, in various ways, spoke in
dispraise of the Buddha, spoke in dispraise of the Dhamma, spoke in
dispraise of the Sangha. However, Suppiya the wanderer's pupil, the brahmin
youth Brahmadatta, in various ways, spoke in praise of the Buddha, spoke in
praise of the Dhamma, spoke in praise of the Sangha. Thus indeed, both
teacher and pupil spoke directly opposing one another as they followed
behind the Auspicious One and the Bhikkhu Sangha.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Then the Auspicious One, having known the topic of conversation of those
bhikkhus, by which [way led to] the round pavilion, by that way he
approached. Having approached, he sat down on a prepared seat. Having sat
down, the Auspicious One addressed the bhikkhus: “What form of
conversation, O bhikkhus, were you having now as you have settled here,
having assembled? And what was the talk underway that was left unfinished by
you?” When thus was said, those bhikkhus said this to the
Auspicious One: “Here, O Bhante, as the night turned to early morning,
we, having arisen, having assembled at the round pavilion, this topic of
conversation arose as we settled: “It is marvellous, O friends. It is
unprecedented, O friends, in so far as the Auspicious One who knows and
sees, the Arahant, the rightly self-awakened One, has well known the diverse
dispositions of beings. Indeed, this Suppiya the wanderer, in various ways,
spoke in dispraise of the Buddha, spoke in dispraise of the Dhamma, spoke in
dispraise of the Sangha. However, Suppiya the wanderer's pupil, the brahmin
youth Brahmadatta, in various ways, spoke in praise of the Buddha, spoke in
praise of the Dhamma, spoke in praise of the Sangha. Thus indeed, both
teacher and pupil spoke directly opposing one another as they followed
behind the Auspicious One and the Bhikkhu Sangha.” This, O Bhante,
was the talk underway that was left unfinished by us. Then the Auspicious
One arrived.”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
“Let this not be, O bhikkhus, if others should speak in dispraise of me,
or should speak in dispraise of the Dhamma, or should speak in dispraise of
the Sangha, no malice, no discontentment, no resentment in the mind is to be
done by you. Let this not be, O bhikkhus, if others should speak in
dispraise of me, or should speak in dispraise of the Dhamma, or should speak
in dispraise of the Sangha. Therein if there is annoyance or displeasure in
you, that is a hindrance for only you. Let this not be, O bhikkhus, if
others should speak in dispraise of me, or should speak in dispraise of the
Dhamma, or should speak in dispraise of the Sangha. Therein if there is
annoyance or displeasure in you, would you understand of others [what is]
well-spoken and badly-spoken?” “Certainly not, Bhante.”
Let this not be, O bhikkhus, if others should speak in dispraise of me, or
should speak in dispraise of the Dhamma, or should speak in dispraise of the
Sangha. Therein, you should unravel the false from the false: “Such as
this is false. Such as this is untrue. But there is not this in us. On the
contrary, this is not to be found in us.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
“Let this not be, O bhikkhus, if others should speak in praise of me, or
should speak in praise of the Dhamma, or should speak in praise of the
Sangha, no rejoicing, no mental pleasure, no elation in the mind is to be
done. Let this not be, O bhikkhus, if others should speak in praise of me,
or should speak in praise of the Dhamma, or should speak in praise of the
Sangha. Therein if there is rejoicing or gladness in you, that is a
hindrance for only you. Let this not be, O bhikkhus, if others should speak
in praise of me, or should speak in praise of the Dhamma, or should speak in
praise of the Sangha. Therein, you should acknowledge the truth from the
truth: “Such as this is true. Such as this is correct. And there is this
in us. And still, this is to be found in us.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
“But this, O bhikkhus, is a trifling, insignificant, mere virtue, by
which one who is a puthujjana might say when speaking in praise of the
Tathagata.” “And which, O bhikkhus, is that trifling,
insignificant, mere virtue by which one who is a puthujjana might say when
speaking in praise of the Tathagata?”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
“Having abandoned the killing of living beings, the samana Gotama
abstains from the killing of living beings. Having buried the rod, having
buried the sword, he dwells conscientious, with kindness and sympathy,
compassionate for the welfare for all living beings.” It is indeed
thus, O bhikkhus, that a puthujjana speaking in praise of the Tathagata
might say.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
“Having abandoned the taking of what is not given, the samana Gotama
abstains from taking what is not given, accepting what is given, expecting
what is given. By not theiving, he dwells having become pure

speaking in praise of the Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
“Having abandoned unchastity, the samana Gotama is a celibate one, living

<p><span class="parno">11</span>

speech. He speaks the truth, he is dependable, reliable, trustworthy, not a

puthujjana speaking in praise of the Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
“Having abandoned divisive speech, the samana Gotama abstains from
divisive speech. Having heard from here, he does not tell there to divide
these [from those], or having heard from there, he does not tell here to
divide those [from these]. Thus is he, a reconciler of the divided, a
bestower of togetherness. He delights in harmony, is delighted with harmony,
rejoices in harmony, utters speech that creates harmony.” Or it is
indeed thus, O bhikkhus, that a puthujjana speaking in praise of the
Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
“Having abandoned harsh speech, the samana Gotama abstains from harsh
speech. That speech which is gentle, pleasant to the ear, endearing,
heartwarming, polite, pleasing to many, agreeable to many, that form of
speech he utters.” Or it is indeed thus, O bhikkhus, that a
puthujjana speaking in praise of the Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>

senseless prattle. He speaks at the proper time, [speech that is] truthful,
meaningful, in accordance with the Dhamma, in accordance with the Vinaya,
speech worth treasuring, at the proper time he utters speech that is
reasonable, speech worth remembering, speech connected with
profit.” Or it is indeed thus, O bhikkhus, that a puthujjana
speaking in praise of the Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>

“Whereas some honorable samanas and brahmanas, having eating food offered
in faith, they earn their living by such forms of wrong livelihood of animal
sciences such as: rituals for peace, rituals for aspirations, rituals for
wisdom, rituals for rainfall, rituals for infertility, rituals for sites,
ceremonies for sites, consecration of sites, ceremonial rinsing of the
mouth, ceremonial bathing, offering of sacrifices, administering emetics,
administering purgatives, administering up-going purgatives, administering
down-going purgatives, administering head purgatives, administering ear
ointments, administering eye restoratives, administering nasal medicine,
administering ointments and counter-ointments; practising fine surgery;
practising general surgery; practising as a children's doctor; the
application of medicinal roots; the binding on of medicinal herbs and
remedies. The samana Gotama abstains from such or such forms of wrong
livelihood.” Or it is indeed thus, O bhikkhus, that a puthujjana
speaking in praise of the Tathagata might say.

<p><span class="parno">33</span>
This, O bhikkhus, is the trifling, insignificant, mere virtues, by which one
who is a puthujjana might say when speaking in praise of the Tathagata.
