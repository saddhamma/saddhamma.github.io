<p><span class="parno">20</span>
O Cunda, of all the Teachers who have arisen in the world at present, I do
not even see one other Teacher, O Cunda, who has attained to such peak of
gain and peak of fame as I have. O Cunda, of all the orders or groups that
have arisen in the world at present, I do not even see one other order, O
Cunda, that has attained to the peak of gain and to the peak of fame as my
bhikkhu Sangha. O Cunda, that which [one] correctly saying would say: “A
life of purity that is complete in all aspects, with nothing lacking and
nothing superfluous, well-proclaimed in its completeness and
purity,” [it would be of] just this life of purity [that one]
correctly saying would say: “A life of purity that is successful in all
aspects, with nothing lacking and nothing superfluous, well-proclaimed in
its completeness and purity.”

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
O Cunda, even Uddaka Ramaputta, [used to] utter such saying:“Seeing, he
does not see.” “But what is it that seeing, one does not see?
You can see the blade of a well-sharpened razor, but not its edge. That is
what was meant by Uddaka Ramaputta, O Cunda, when saying: “Seeing, he
does not see.” He spoke in reference to a low, vulgar, worldly,
ignoble, unbeneficial thing, a mere razor.” O Cunda, that which
[one] correctly saying would say: “Seeing, he does not see,” [it
would be of] just this [that one] correctly saying would say: “Seeing, he
does not see.”

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
“And what is it that seeing, one does not see?” Indeed, this is
truly what he sees: “A life of purity that is successfull in all aspects,
complete in all aspects, with nothing lacking and nothing superfluous,
well-proclaimed in its completeness and purity.” If he were to
deduct anything from it, thinking: “In this way it will be
purer”, then he does not see it. And if he were to add anything to
it, thinking: “In this way it will be more complete”, then he
does not see it. This is [the proper meaning of] “seeing, he does not
see.”

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
O Cunda, that which [one] correctly saying would say: “A life of purity
that is successful in all aspects, with nothing lacking and nothing
superfluous, well-proclaimed in its completeness and purity,” [it
would be of] just this life of purity [that one] correctly saying would say:
“A life of purity that is successful in all aspects, with nothing lacking
and nothing superfluous, well-proclaimed in its completeness and
purity.”

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
Therefore, O Cunda, all of you to whom the Dhamma has been taught by me from
higher knowledge, entirely all of you having assembled, having met together
at a place, should recite them meaning by meaning, phrasing by phrasing,
without any disagreement [in meaning and phrasing], in order that this life
of purity may last for a long time, persist for a long time, for the welfare
of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the
good, welfare and happiness of devas and humans. And what, O Cunda, are
those Dhammas taught by me from higher knowledge which entirely all of you
having assembled, having met together at a place, should recite them meaning
by meaning, phrasing by phrasing, without any disagreement [in meaning and
phrasing], in order that this life of purity may last for a long time,
persist for a long time, for the welfare of many, for the happiness of many,
out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare and happiness of
devas and humans? They are: The four establishments of mindfulness, the four
right strivings, the four bases for superhuman power, the five faculties,
the five powers, the seven awakening factors, the noble eightfold
path. These, O Cunda, are the Dhammas taught by me from higher knowledge
which entirely all of you having assembled, having met together at a place,
should recite them meaning by meaning, phrasing by phrasing, without any
disagreement [in meaning and phrasing], in order that this life of purity
may last for a long time, persist for a long time, for the welfare of many,
for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the good,
welfare and happiness of devas and humans.

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
And for all of you, O Cunda, having assembled in harmony, without
dissension, it should be trained [thus:] A certain [person] in the life of
purity might speak the Dhamma in the Sangha. Therein, if it occurs to you
all thus: “This venerable simply takes the meaning wrongly, [and] lays
the phrasing wrongly,” you should not simply applaud it, should not
reject it. Not having applauded it, not having rejected it, he should be
told thus: “O friend, of these phrasings or these phrasings, which is the
more suitable for this meaning? Of this meaning or this meaning, which is
the more suitable for these phrasings?” If he would say thus:
“For this meaning, O friend, only these phrasings are more suitable; for
these phrasings, only this meaning is more suitable;” he should
simply not be dismissed, he should not be disparaged. Not having simply
dismissed, not having disparaged, just the correct meaning and phrasing
should be carefully and thoroughly explained by you for him.

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
Also, O Cunda, if another in the life of purity should speak the Dhamma in
the Sangha, [and] therein, if it occurs to you all thus: “This venerable
simply takes the meaning wrongly, [but] lays the phrasing
correctly,” you should not simply applaud it, should not reject
it. Not having applauded it, not having rejected it, he should be told thus:
“O friend, of this meaning or this meaning, which is the more suitable
for these phrasings?” If he would say thus: “For these
phrasings, only this meaning is more appropriate,” he should not
simply be dismissed, he should not be disparaged. Not having simply
dismissed, not having disparaged, just the correct meaning should be
carefully and thoroughly explained by you for him.

<p><span class="parno">27</span>
Yet, O Cunda, another in the life of purity might speak the Dhamma in the
Sangha. Therein, if it occurs to you all thus: “Indeed, this venerable
takes the meaning correctly, [but] lays the phrasing wrongly,” you
should not simply applaud it, should not reject it. Not having applauded it,
not having rejected it, he should be told thus: “O friend, of these
phrasings or these phrasings, which is the more suitable for this
meaning?” If he would say thus: “For this meaning, O friend,
only these phrasings are more suitable,” he should not simply be
dismissed, he should not be disparaged. Not having simply dismissed, not
having disparaged, just the correct phrasing should be carefully and
thoroughly explained by you for him.

<p><span class="parno">28</span>
Also, O Cunda, if another in the life of purity should speak the Dhamma in
the Sangha, [and] therein, if it occurs to you all thus: “This venerable
simply takes the meaning correctly, is one who lays the phrasing
correctly,” you should delight in it, you should rejoice in it,
saying Good. Having delighted in it, having rejoiced in it saying Good!, he
should be told thus: “It is a gain for us, O friend, it is well gained by
us, O friend, that we see such a venerable in the life of purity, so endowed
with the meaning, endowed with the phrasings.

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
“O Cunda, I do not teach the Dhamma to you all for the restraint of the
asavas in the present life only. Yet, O Cunda, I do not teach the Dhamma for
the warding off of the asavas in future lives only. But indeed, I, O Cunda,
teach the Dhamma for the restraint of the asavas in the present life and for
the warding off of the asavas in future lives. Therefore for you all, O
Cunda, let the robes that have been made allowable by me be surely enough
merely for warding off cold, for warding off heat, for warding off contacts
of gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and creepy crawlers, merely for
concealing that which brings shame.

<p><span class="parno">30</span>
For you all, let the alms food that have been made allowable by me be surely
enough neither for enjoyment nor for intoxication, nor for decoration, nor
for beautification, [but] merely for the sustenance of this body, for
nourishment, for abstinence from harm [and] for assisting the life of
purity. “Thus my termination of the former feeling will not give rise to
a new feeling. And life support for me will be blameless and one of
comfortable abiding.”).

<p><span class="parno">31</span>
For you all, let the lodgings that have been made allowable by me be surely
enough merely for warding off cold, for warding off heat, for warding off
contacts of gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and creepy crawlers, merely for
allaying the perils of the seasons, [and] for the purpose of enjoying
seclusion.

<p><span class="parno">32</span>
For you all, let the medicinal requisites for support when sick that have
been made allowable by me be surely enough merely for warding off arisen
afflictive feelings, for freedom from oppression at most.”

<p><span class="parno">33</span>
But it is possible, O Cunda, it is to be found, that wanderers of other
standpoints might say thus: “The samanas who are sons of the Sakyan dwell
engaged in quests for pleasure.” O Cunda, wanderers of other
standpoints who may speak thus should be told thus: “What [kind of]
quests for pleasure, O friend? Indeed there are many different kinds,
various types of quests for pleasure.”

<p><span class="parno">34</span>
These four quests for pleasure, O Cunda, are low, vulgar, worldly, ignoble,
unbeneficial, does not lead to disenchantment, to fading away, to cessation,
to appeasement, to higher knowledge, to self-awakening, to nibbana. Which
four? Here O Cunda, a certain foolish person pleases and amuses himself
having killed living beings. This is the first quest for
pleasure. Furthermore, O Cunda, here, a certain person pleases and amuses
himself having taken what is not given, unseen. This is the second quest for
pleasure. Furthermore, O Cunda, here, a certain person pleases and amuses
himself having lied. This is the third quest for pleasure. Furthermore, O
Cunda, here, a certain person indeed, being furnished and endowed with the
five cords of sensual pleasure, causes to amuse himself. This is the fourth
quest for pleasure. These, O Cunda, are the four quests for pleasure which
are low, vulgar, worldly, ignoble, unbeneficial, does not lead to
disenchantment, to fading away, to cessation, to appeasement, to higher
knowledge, to self-awakening, to nibbana.

<p><span class="parno">35</span>
But it is possible, O Cunda, it is to be found that wanderers of other
standpoints might say thus: “Are the samanas who are sons of the Sakyan
engaged in these four quests for pleasure?” for you all, 'it not
(or do not or this is not to be done) “Indeed not so” is to be
well said. [For] they would not be rightly speaking about you, [but] would
be accusing you with false and unheard-of statements.

<p><span class="parno">36</span>
These four quests for pleasure, O Cunda, lead unerringly to disenchantment,
to fading away, to cessation, to appeasement, to higher knowledge, to
self-awakening, to nibbana. Which four? Here O Cunda, quite secluded from
sense-desires, secluded from unwholesome dhammas, [a bhikkhu ] enters upon
and abides in the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, connected with
thinking and pondering, the first jhana. This is the first quest for
pleasure. Furthermore, O Cunda, from the subsiding of thinking and
pondering, with the internal tranquilization and unification of mind [due
to] the absence of thinking and pondering, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides
in the rapture and pleasure born of samadhi, the second jhana. This is the
second quest for pleasure.

<p><span class="parno">37</span>
Furthermore, O Cunda, a bhikkhu with detachment from rapture, a bhikkhu
dwelling mindful and clearly comprehending, looks on with equanimity as he
experiences pleasure in the body, of which the Noble Ones say: “He is a
mindful one who [looks on with] equanimity, one who dwells in
pleasure,” enters upon and abides in the third jhana. This is the
third quests for pleasure. Furthermore, O Cunda, from the abandoning of
[physical] pleasure and pain, from the disappearance of former mental
pleasure and mental pain, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the utter
purity of mindfulness and equanimity without pain and pleasure, the fourth
jhana. This is the fourth quests for pleasure. These, O Cunda, are the four
quests for pleasure leading unerringly to disenchantment, to fading away, to
cessation, to appeasement, to higher knowledge, to self-awakening, to
nibbana.

<p><span class="parno">38</span>
But it is possible, O Cunda, it is to be found that wanderers of other
standpoints might say thus: “Do the samanas who are sons of the Sakyan
dwell engaged in these four quests for pleasure?” for you all,
“Yes, ” is to be well said. [For] they would be rightly speaking
about you, they would not be accusing you with false and unheard-of
statements.

<p><span class="parno">39</span>
But it is possible, O Cunda, it is to be found that wanderers of other
standpoints might say thus: “But for those who dwell engaged in these
four quests for pleasure, O friend, how many fruits, how many benefits, are
to be expected?” O Cunda, wanderers of other standpoints who speak
thus should be told thus: “For those, O friend, who dwell engaged in
these four quests for pleasure, four fruits, four benefits are to be
expected. Which four? Here, O friend, from the complete destruction of the
three fetters, a bhikkhu is a sotapanna, not subject to the woeful plane, on
a fixed course, destined for supreme awakening. This is the first fruit, the
first benefit. Furthermore, O friend, from the complete destruction of the
three fetters and reduction of greed, hatred and delusion, a bhikkhu is a
sakadagami, who having come back only once to this world, makes the end of
suffering. This is the second fruit, the second benefit. Furthermore, O
friend, from the complete destruction of the five fetters that binds one to
the near shore, a bhikkhu comes to be born spontaneously [in the pure
abodes]. He is one bound to attained final nibbana in that place, not
subject to return from that world. Furthermore, O Mahali, with the
destruction of the asavas, a bhikkhu, having realized for himself with
direct knowledge, in this very life, the asava-free mind liberation, wisdom
liberation, and having entered upon it, dwells in it. This is the fourth
fruit, the fourth benefit. These four fruits, O friend, four benefits, are
to be expected for those who dwell engaged in these four quests for
pleasure.”
