<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Thus was heard by me. At one time the Auspicious One dwelled at Vesali, in
the Great Wood, at the Hall with the Peaked Roof. At that time, many Kosalan
and Magadhan Brahmin envoys also dwelled in Vesali on some business. Those
Kosalan and Magadhan Brahmiṇ envoys heard: “The samana Gotama, son of the
Sakyans, having gone forth from the Sakyan clan, abides in this Vesali, at
the Hall with the Peaked Roof. Now a good reputation has been spread about
that Auspicious Gotama thus: “Truly is he the Auspicious One, the
Arahant, rightly self-awakened, excelling in knowledge and conduct,
well-farer, knower of worlds, incomparable charioteer of tamed persons,
teacher of devas and humans, awakened, auspicious.” Having realized
this world with its devas, maras and brahmas, together with the population
of samanas and brahmanas, devas and humans, he causes to make it known. He
teaches the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good
in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, making known the life of
purity that is utterly perfect and pure. Now good is the sight of such
arahants.”

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Then, by which way [led to] the Great Wood, at the Hall with the Peaked
Roof, by that way the Kosalan and Magadhan Brahmin envoys approached. At
that time the venerable Nagita was the Auspicious One's attendant. Then, by
which way [led to] the venerable Nagita, by that way the Kosalan and
Magadhan Brahmin envoys approached. Having approached the venerable Nagita,
they said this: “Where, O Master Nagita, is he, the good Gotama, abiding
at present? Indeed, we have a desire to see that Auspicious
Gotama.” “It is not the right time, O friends, for seeing the
Auspicious One. The Auspicious One is in seclusion.” Then, those
Kosalan and Magadhan Brahmin envoys sat down just there on one side
[thinking]: “Only having seen that Auspicious Gotama will we
go.”

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Also, by which way [led to] the venerable Nagita in the Great Wood, at the
Hall with the Peaked Roof, by that way Otthaddha the Licchavi approached
with a large Licchavi assembly. Having approached the venerable Nagita,
having bowed down, he stood on one side. Having stood on one side, Otthaddha
the Licchavi, too, said this to the venerable Nagita: “Where, O Bhante
Nagita, is he, the Auspicious One, the Arahant, the rightly self-awakened
One abiding at present? We have a desire to see that Auspicious One, the
Arahant, the rightly self-awakened one.”

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
“It is not the right time, O Mahali, for seeing the Auspicious One. The
Auspicious One is in seclusion.” Otthaddha the Licchavi, too sat
down just there on one side [thinking]: “Only having seen that Auspicious
One, the Arahant, the rightly self-awakened One, will I go.”

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
So then, by which way [led to] the venerable Nagita, by that way Siha the
novice approached. Having approached the venerable Nagita, having bowed
down, he stood on one side. Having stood on one side, Siha the novice, said
this to the venerable Nagita: “O Bhante Kassapa, these many Kosalan and
Magadhan Brahmin envoys have approached here to see the Auspicious
One. Otthaddha the Licchavi too, has approached here with a large assembly
to see the Auspicious One. It will be good, O Bhante Kassapa, if these
people get to see the Auspicious One.”

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
“Well then Siha, you just inform the Auspicious One.” “Yes,
Bhante.” Siha the novice, having replied to the venerable Nagita,
by which way [led to] the Auspicious One, by that way he approached. Having
bowed down to the Auspicious One, he stood on one side. Having stood on one
side, Siha the novice said this to the Auspicious One: O Bhante, these many
Kosalan and Magadhan Brahmin envoys have approached here to see the
Auspicious One. Otthaddha the Licchavi too, has approached here with a large
assembly to see the Auspicious One. It will be good, O Bhante, if these
people get to see the Auspicious One.”

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
“Well then Siha, prepare a seat in the shade of the dwelling.”

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
“Yes, Bhante.” Siha the novice, having replied to the Auspicious
One, prepared a seat in the shade of the dwelling. Then the Auspicious One,
having gone out of his dwelling, sat down on the seat prepared in the shade
of the dwelling.

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
So then, by which way [led to] the Auspicious One, by that way those Kosalan
and Magadhan Brahmin envoys approached. Having approached the Auspicious
One, they exchanged greetings. Having exchanged friendly greetings and
cordial talk, they sat down to one side. Also, by which way [led to] the
Auspicious One, by that way Otthaddha the Licchavī approached with a large
Licchavi assembly. Having approached  the Auspicious One, having bowed down,
he sat down to one side. Having sat down to one side, Otthaddha the Licchavi
said this to the Auspicious One:

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
Formerly, O Bhante, a day before, Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis,
approached me. Having approached me, he said this: “So far, O Mahali, in
no long time, it will be three years since I lived in dependence on the
Auspicious One. Indeed, I see divine forms that are enticing, connected with
sensual desires, provocative of lust. But I do not hear divine sounds that
are enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust.”
“O Bhante, are there also divine sounds that are enticing, connected with
sensual desires, provocative of lust, that Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis
cannot hear, or are there not?”

<p><span class="parno">11</span>
“There are, O Mahali, also divine sounds that are enticing, connected
with sensual desires, provocative of lust, that Sunakkhatta, son of the
Licchavis cannot hear. It is not [the case that] there are not.”

<p><span class="parno">12</span>
“What, O Bhante is the cause? What is the reason why there are also
divine sounds that are enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative
of lust, that Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis cannot hear, and not [the
case that] there are not?”

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
Here, O Mahali, a bhikkhu unilaterally develops a samadhi for the seeing of
divine forms that are enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative
of lust in the eastern direction, but not for the hearing of divine sounds
that are enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust. In
that unilaterally developed samadhi for the seeing of divine forms that are
enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust in the eastern
direction, but not for the hearing of divine sounds that are enticing,
connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust, he sees divine forms
that are enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust in
the eastern direction, but does not hear divine sounds that are enticing,
connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust. What is the reason for
that? Because it is just so, O Mahali, for a bhikkhu who one-sidedly
develops a samadhi for the seeing of divine forms that are enticing,
connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust in the eastern
direction, but not for the hearing of divine sounds that are enticing,
connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust.

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
Furthermore, O Mahali, a bhikkhu unilaterally develops a samadhi for the
seeing of divine forms that are enticing, connected with sensual desires,
provocative of lust in the southern direction, but not for the hearing of

forms that are enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust
in the southern direction, but not for the hearing of divine sounds that are
enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust, he sees
divine forms that are enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative
of lust in the southern direction, but does not hear divine sounds that are
enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust. What is the
reason for that? Because it is just so, O Mahali, for a bhikkhu who
unilaterally develops a samadhi for the seeing of divine forms that are
enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust in the
southern direction, but not for the hearing of divine sounds that are
enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust.

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
Furthermore, O Mahali, a bhikkhu unilaterally develops a samadhi for the
seeing of divine forms that are enticing, connected with sensual desires,
provocative of lust in the western direction, but not for the hearing of
divine sounds that are enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative
of lust. In that unilaterally developed samadhi for the seeing of divine
forms that are enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust

divine forms that are enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative
of lust in the western direction, but does not hear divine sounds that are
enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust. What is the

direction, but not for the hearing of divine sounds that are enticing,
connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust.

of lust. In that unilaterally developed samadhi for the seeing of divine
forms that are enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust
in the northern direction, but not for the hearing of divine sounds that are

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
Furthermore, O Mahali, a bhikkhu unilaterally develops a samadhi for the
seeing of divine forms that are enticing, connected with sensual desires,
provocative of lust, above, below and across, but not for the hearing of
divine sounds that are enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative
of lust. In that unilaterally developed samadhi for the seeing of divine

and across, but not for the hearing of divine sounds that are enticing,
connected with sensual desires, provocative of lust.

<p><span class="parno">18</span>

“This, O Bhante is the cause. This is the reason why there are also
divine sounds that are enticing, connected with sensual desires, provocative
of lust, that Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis cannot hear, and not [the
case that] there are not?”

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
“Surely, O Bhante, the realization of this samādhi development is the
reason bhikkhus live the life of purity under the Auspicious One.”

<p><span class="parno">30</span>
“No Mahali, the realization of this samādhi development is not the reason
bhikkhus live the life of purity under me. There are, O Mahali, certainly
other dhammas that are higher and more excellent for the realization of
which is the reason bhikkhus live the life of purity under me.”

<p><span class="parno">32</span>
“But, O Bhante, what are those dhammas that are higher and more
excellent, for the realization of which is the reason bhikkhus live the life
of purity under the Auspicious One?”

<p><span class="parno">34</span>
Here, O Mahali, from the complete destruction of the three fetters, a
bhikkhu is a sotapanna, not subject to the woeful plane, on a fixed course,
destined for supreme awakening. This, O Mahali, is a higher and more
excellent dhamma, for the realization of which is the reason bhikkhus live

Furthermore, O Mahali, from the complete destruction of the three fetters
and reduction of greed, hatred and delusion, a bhikkhu is a sakadagami, who
having come back only once to this world, makes the end of suffering. This
too, O Mahali, is a higher and more excellent dhamma, for the realization of
which is the reason bhikkhus live the life of purity under me.

<p><span class="parno">38</span>
Furthermore, O Mahali, from the complete destruction of the five fetters
that binds one to the near shore, a bhikkhu comes to be born spontaneously
[in the pure abodes]. He is one bound to attained final nibbana in that
place, not subject to return from that world. This too, O Mahali, is a
higher and more excellent dhamma, for the realization of which is the reason
bhikkhus live the life of purity under me.

<p><span class="parno">40</span>
Furthermore, O Mahali, with the destruction of the asavas, a bhikkhu, having
realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the
asava-free mind liberation, wisdom liberation, and having entered upon it,
dwells in it. This too, O Mahali, is a higher and more excellent dhamma, for
the realization of which is the reason bhikkhus live the life of purity
under me.These, O Mahali, are those dhammas that are higher and more
excellent for the realization of which is the reason bhikkhus live the life
of purity under me.”

<p><span class="parno">42</span>
“But, O Bhante, is there a path, is there a means for progress for the
realization of these dhammas?”

<p><span class="parno">44</span>
“There is a path, O Mahali, there is a means for progress for the
realization of these dhammas.”

<p><span class="parno">46</span>
“But, O Bhante, what is the path, what is the means for progress for the

<p><span class="parno">48</span>
“It is just this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right
thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness, right samadhi. This, O Mahali, is the path, this is the means
for progress for the realization of these dhammas.”
