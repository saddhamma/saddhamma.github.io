The value being so small, Rhys Davids is against the notion that the <i lang="pi">kaṃsa</i> was a bronze or brass cup, plate or vessel. It may possibly have been a bronze weight such as those used until recently in Burma. There is no commentarial support for Childers’ view that <i lang="pi">kaṃsa</i> is “a coin," or for Böhtlingroth’s that it is an equivalent of <i lang="pi">āḍhaka</i> (Pali, <i lang="pi">āḷhaka</i>).</span></span></span> If she should bargain for one (worth) more than that, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.</span>"</p>
