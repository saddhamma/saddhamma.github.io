<h2>Bhikkhu Vibhanga - Pācittiya 3: The Training Rule on Malicious Talebearing.</h2>

<div id="metaarea">

<h2 id="nidana">Origin story</h2>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.12"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.3.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.186"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time some monks belonging to the group of six were engaging in malicious talebearing among monks who were quarrelling, arguing, and disputing. After hearing something on one side they reported it to the other side, and vice versa, in order to create division between them. In this way new quarrels were created and existing quarrels became worse.<br>

<br>The monks of few desires … complained and criticised them: “How can those monks belonging to the group of six engage in malicious talebearing among monks who are quarrelling, arguing, and disputing? And after hearing something on one side, how can they report it to the other side, and vice versa, in order to create division between them, and in this way create new quarrels and make existing quarrels worse?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
After criticising those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that you are acting in this way?" “It’s true, Master." The Buddha, the Master, criticised them: “ … Foolish men, how can you engage in malicious talebearing among monks who are quarrelling, arguing, and disputing? And after hearing something on one side, how can you report it to the other side, and vice versa, in order to create division between them, and in this way create new quarrels and make existing quarrels worse? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it, nor increase the confidence of those who have it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h2 id="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">3</span>
“If a monk engages in malicious talebearing, he commits an offence entailing confession."</p>

<h2 id="pada">Definitions</h2>

<a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.3.2"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.3.2.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.187"></a>Malicious talebearing: there is in malicious talebearing in two ways: for one wanting to endear himself or for one aiming at division. He engages in malicious talebearing in ten ways: about caste, about name, about family, about work, about trade, about illnesses, about physical traits, about defilements, about offences, and by insulting.

<h2 id="cakka">Permutations</h2>

<h3 id="anucakka1">Permutations part 1</h3>

<h4 id="anupada">Definitions</h4>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Caste: there are two kinds of castes: low castes and high castes. Low castes: outcasts, bamboo workers, hunters, chariot-makers, waste-removers. These are called low castes. High castes: nobles and brahmans. These are called high castes.</p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
Insults: there are two kinds of insults: low insults and high insults. Low insults: you are a camel, you are a ram, you are an ox, you are a donkey, you are an animal, you are bound for hell; you are not going to a good destination, you can only expect a bad destination; adding the disparaging endings <i>ya</i> or <i>bha</i> to someone’s name, or calling someone words for the male and female genitals. These are called low <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.13"></a> insults. High insults: you are wise, you are competent, you are intelligent, you are learned, you are a Dhamma-speaker; you are not going to a bad destination, you can only expect a good destination. These are called high insults.</p>
