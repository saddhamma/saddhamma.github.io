<h2 id="nidana">Origin story</h2>

<h3 id="anunidana1">First sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.33.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.315"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. At that time in Vesālī a succession of fine meals had been arranged. A certain poor worker then thought, “Why donʼt I prepare a meal? It will not be inferior compared to the meal respectfully prepared by these people."<br>

<br>Then that worker went to his boss Kira and said: “Young Master, I wish to prepare a meal for the Sangha of monks headed by <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.76"></a> the Buddha. Give me my salary."<br>

<br>Because Kira also had faith and confidence, he gave the worker his salary and much extra. That worker then went to the Master, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. He then said: “Bhante, please accept a meal from me tomorrow together with the Sangha of monks."<br>

<br>“Do you know that the Sangha of monks is large?"<br>

<br>“Let the Sangha be large, bhante. I have prepared much jujube and <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.316"></a> also drinks mixed with jujube." And the Master consented by remaining silent.
</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
The worker understood that the Master had consented, and he rose from his seat, circumambulated the Master with his right side towards him, and left.<br>

<br>The monks heard that a poor worker had invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for a meal on the following day, complete with drinks mixed with jujube. And so they ate in the morning after walking for alms.<br>

<br>When people heard that a poor worker had invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for a meal, they brought much food of various kinds to him. The following morning that worker prepared that food, and then informed the Master: “Itʼs time, bhante, the meal is ready."</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Then, after dressing in the morning, the Master took his bowl and robe and went to the house of that poor worker, where he sat down on the prepared seat, together with the Sangha. That worker then served the monks in the kitchen. But the monks kept saying, “Give just little!"<br>

<br>“Bhantes, do not accept so little because you think I am just poor worker. I have prepared much food of various kinds. Bhantes, please accept as much as you like."<br>

<br>“We are not accepting so little because of that, but because we ate in the morning after walking for alms."</p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.317"></a>Then that poor worker complained and criticised them: “How can the venerables eat elsewhere when invited by me? Am I not able to give as much as they need?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Monks heard the complaints of that <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.77"></a> worker, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticised those monks: “How can those monks eat elsewhere when invited for a meal?" … “Is it true, monks, that monks do this?" “It’s true, Master." The Buddha, the Master, criticised them: “ … How can those foolish men eat elsewhere when invited for a meal? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3 id="anupannatti1">Preliminary ruling</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">6</span>
“If a monk eats one meal before another, he commits an offence entailing confession."</p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">7</span>
In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>

<h3 id="anunidana2">Second sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.33.2"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.318"></a>Soon afterwards a monk became sick. Another monk took some almsfood, went to that monk, and told him to eat it.<br>

<br>“I can’t, I’m expecting another meal."<br>

<br>But that almsfood only arrived at noon, and that monk was not able to eat as much as he had intended. They then informed the Master of what had happened. The Master then spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat one meal before another. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3 id="anupannatti2">Preliminary ruling</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">9</span>
“If a monk eats one meal before another, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. The appropriate reason is this: the monk is sick."</p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">10</span>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>

<h3 id="anunidana3">Third sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">11</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.33.3"></a>Around that time, during the robe-giving season, people prepared a meal together with robe-cloth, and then invited the monks: “We wish to offer you a meal and then give you robe-cloth." Knowing that the Master had prohibited eating one meal before another and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. As a result they only obtained a small amount of robe-cloth. They informed the Master of what had happened. … “Monks, I allow you to eat one meal before another when robe-cloth is being given. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3 id="anupannatti3">Preliminary ruling</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">12</span>“If a monk eats one meal before another, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. The appropriate reasons are these: the monk is sick, robe-cloth is being given."</p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">13</span>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>

<h3 id="anunidana4">Fourth sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>Around that time, people invited monks who were making a robe for a meal. Knowing that the Master had prohibited eating one meal before another and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. They informed the Master of what had happened. … “Monks, I allow you to eat one meal before another when a robe is being made. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h2 id="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">15</span>“If a monk eats one meal before another, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. The appropriate reasons are these: a monk is sick, robe-cloth is being given, a robe is being made."</p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">16</span>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>

<h3 id="anunidana5">Fifth sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">17</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.33.4"></a>Around that time, the Master dressed in the morning, took his bowl and <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.78"></a> robe and went to a certain family with Venerable Ānanda as his attendant. <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.319"></a> He sat down on the prepared seat and the people gave him and Venerable Ānanda staple food. Being afraid of wrongdoing, Venerable Ānanda did not accept it. The Master said: “Accept it, Ānanda."<br>

<br>“I can’t, Master, I’m expecting another meal."<br>

<br>“Well then, Ānanda, assign the other meal to someone else and then receive this."<br>

<br>Soon afterwards the Master spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks: “<span class="subrule">Monks, I allow you to eat one meal before another if you assign the other meal to someone else. And, monks, this is how it should be assigned: ‘I give my expected meal to so-and-so.’</span>"</p>

<h2 id="pada">Definitions</h2>

<p><span class="parno">18</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.33.5"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.33.5.1"></a>Eats one meal before another: if he has been invited to eat any of the five staple foods, and he then eats any of the five staple foods elsewhere, this is called, ‘eats one meal before another.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>Unless there is an appropriate reason: except at an appropriate time.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>A monk is sick: if he is not able to eat as much as he needs in one go, he may eat one meal
before another. </p>

<p><span class="parno">21</span>Robe-cloth is being given: if he has not done the <i>kathina</i> ceremony, he may eat one meal before another during the last month of the rainy season. If he has done the <i>kathina</i> ceremony, he may eat one meal before another during the five month period.<span class="note"> <span class="details"><span class="p">That is, the last month of the rainy season, plus the four months of the cold season,</span></span></span></p>

<p><span class="parno">22</span>A robe is being made: when a robe is being made, he may eat one meal before another.</p>

<p><span class="parno">23</span>If he receives food with the intention of eating it, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence of bad conduct. For every mouthful, he commits an offence entailing confession.</p>

<h2 id="cakka">Permutations</h2>

<p><span class="parno">24</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.33.5.2"></a>If it is one meal before another, and he perceives it as one meal before another, and he eats it, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. If it is one meal before another, but he has doubts about it, and he eats it, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. If it is one meal before another, but he does not perceive it as one meal before another, and he eats it, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession.</p>

<p><span class="parno">25</span>If it is not one meal before another, but he perceives it as one meal before another, he commits an offence of bad conduct. If it is not one meal before another, but he has doubts about it, he commits an offence of bad conduct. If it is not one meal before another, and he does not perceive it as one meal before another, there is no offence.</p>

<h2 id="anapatti">Non-offences</h2>

<p><span class="parno">26</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.33.5.3"></a>There is no offence: if he has an appropriate reason; if he assigns his other meal to someone else and then eats; if he eats the food from two or three <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.320"></a> invitations together; if he eats the meals in the same order that the invitations were received; if he is invited by a whole village and he eats anywhere in that village; if he is invited by a whole association and he eats anywhere within that association; if, when being invited, he says, “I will get almsfood;" if it is a regular meal invitation; if it is a meal invitation decided by drawing lots; if it is on the half-moon day; if it is on the <i>uposatha</i> day; if it is on the day after the <i>uposatha</i>; if it is anything apart from the five staple foods; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.</p>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">27</span>The third rule, the training rule on eating one meal before another, is finished.</p>
