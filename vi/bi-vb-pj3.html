<h2>Bhikkhuni Vibhanga - Pārājika 3: Killing A Human</h2>

<div id="metaarea">
	<ul class="translator">
		<li>(The same as the bhikkhu's Pārājika 3)</li>
		<li>Translated from the Pali by Ebo Croffie (coming sooner or later).</li>
<p><span class="parno">1. Bu-Pj.3, Bu-Pj.3.1, Bu-Pj.3.1.1, MS.376, BD.1.116, Vin.3.68</span>
<span class="note"> <span class="details"><span class="p">This story also occurs at <a href="../sn/sn54.9.html"> SN54.9"></a>. The problems raised by the story are discussed in Mills, "The Case of the Murdered Monks."</span></span></span>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.At that time the Master talked in many ways to the monks on the subject of unattractiveness, he spoke in praise of unattractiveness, he spoke in praise of developing (the perception of) unattractiveness, he spoke thus and thus he spoke in many ways in praise of the attainment of unattractiveness.
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.377"></a>
 Then the Master addressed the monks:</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>"Monks, I wish to go into solitary retreat for half a month. No one is to approach me except the one who brings me almsfood."<br>
<br>"Yes, Master," the monks replied, and accordingly no one approached the Master except the one to take him almsfood.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.378"></a>
Then the monks thought, "The Master has talked in many ways on the subject of unattractiveness," and they dwelt intent upon the practice of developing (the perception of) unattractiveness in its many different aspects. As a consequence they became troubled by their own bodies, ashamed of them, loathing them.
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.117"></a>
 Just as a young woman or man, fond of adornments and with head washed, would be ashamed, humiliated and disgusted if the carcase of a snake, a dog or a man were hung around their neck, just so those monks were troubled by their own bodies, ashamed of them and loathed them. They took their own lives, took the lives of one another, and they approached Migalaṇḍika, a sham recluse, the recluse lookalike, and said, "Friend, please kill us. This bowl and robe will be yours." Then Migalaṇḍika, hired for a bowl and robe,
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.118"></a>
 killed a number of monks.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
He then took his
<span class="pts">blood-stained</span> knife to the river Vaggumudā,
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.379"></a>
 and while he was washing it he became anxious and remorseful: "Indeed, itʼs a loss for me, itʼs no gain; indeed, itʼs badly gained by me, not
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.69"></a>
 well-gained. I have made much demerit because I have killed monks who were virtuous and of good conduct."<br>
<br>Then a certain god of Māraʼs retinue, walking across the water, said to Migalaṇḍika, "Well done, superior man; it is a gain for you, it is well-gained. You have made much merit, because you bring those across who have not yet crossed."</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">5</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.119"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.380"></a>
Then Migalaṇḍika thought, "So it seems it is a gain for me, that it is well-gained by me, and that I have made much merit by bringing those across who have not yet crossed." He then went from dwelling to dwelling, from dormitory to dormitory, and said, "Who has not yet crossed? Whom do I bring across?" And those monks who were not free from desire became fearful and terrified, with their hair standing on end, but not so those who were free from desire.
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.381"></a></p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>Then Migalaṇḍika killed a monk, on a single day he killed two monks, on a single day … three … four … five … ten … twenty … thirty … forty … fifty … on a single day he killed sixty monks.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">7. Bu-Pj.3.1.2, MS.382</span>
At the end of that half-month, the Master arose from seclusion and addressed Venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, why is the Sangha of monks so diminished?"<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.120"></a>
"It is because the Master talked to the monks in many ways on the subject of unattractiveness— he spoke in praise of unattractiveness, in praise of developing (the perception of) unattractiveness, and in many ways in praise of the attainment of unattractiveness. And, Master, those monks thought, ‘The Master has talked in many ways on the subject of unattractiveness,ʼ and so they dwelt intent upon the practice of developing (the perception of) unattractiveness in its many different aspects. As a consequence they became troubled by their own bodies, ashamed of them, loathing them. Just as a young woman or man, fond of adornments and with head washed, would be ashamed, humiliated and disgusted if the carcase of a snake, a dog or a man were hung around their neck, just so these monks were troubled by their own bodies,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.70"></a>
 ashamed of them, loathing them. They then took their own lives, took the lives of each other, and they approached Migalaṇḍika, the recluse lookalike, and said, ʻFriend, please kill us. This bowl and robe will be yours.’ Then, Master, hired for a bowl and robe, Migalaṇḍika killed a monk … on a single day he killed sixty monks. Master, please give another instruction for the Sangha of monks to be established in final knowledge."<br>
<br>"Well then, Ānanda, call together in the assembly-hall all the monks that dwell near Vesālī."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.121"></a>
"Yes, Master," he said. And when he had done so, he approached the Master and said, "Master, the Sangha of monks is assembled. Master, please do what you think is appropriate."</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">8</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.383"></a>
Then the Master went to the assembly-hall, sat down on the prepared seat, and said:</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">9. Bu-Pj.3.1.3, MS.384</span>
"Monks, the <i lang="pi">samādhi</i> by mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is peaceful and sublime, an exalted state of happiness, and it stops and settles bad, unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise. Just as a big storm, when it arises out of season in the last month of the hot weather, stops and settles the dust and dirt in the atmosphere—even so the <i lang="pi">samādhi</i> by mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is peaceful and sublime, an exalted state of happiness, and it stops and settles bad, unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise.
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.385"></a></p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>
 And how is the <i lang="pi">samādhi</i> by mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated in this way?<br>
<br>As to that, monks, a monk sits down in the wilderness, at
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.122"></a>
 the foot of a tree, or in an empty hut; he crosses his legs, straightens his body, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. Simply mindful, he breathes in; simply mindful, he breathes out.
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.386"></a></p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>When he breathes in long, he knows it; and when he breathes out long, he knows that. When he breathes in short, he knows it; and when he breathes out short, he knows that. While breathing in, he trains in having the full experience (of the breath);
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.71"></a>
 while breathing out, he trains in having the full experience (of the breath). While breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the body; while breathing out, he trains in calming the activity of the body.
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.387"></a></p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>While breathing in, he trains in experiencing rapture; while breathing out, he trains in experiencing rapture. While breathing in, he trains in experiencing happiness; while breathing out, he trains in experiencing happiness. While breathing in, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind; while breathing out, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind. While breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the mind; while breathing out, he trains in calming the activity of the mind. While breathing in, he trains in experiencing the mind; while breathing out, he trains in experiencing the mind. <br>
<br>While breathing in, he trains in gladdening the mind; while breathing out, he trains in gladdening the mind. While breathing in, he trains in unifying the mind; while breathing out, he trains in unifying the mind. While breathing in, he trains in freeing the mind; while breathing out, he trains in freeing the mind.

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">14</span> .. While breathing in, he trains in contemplating impermanence; while breathing out, he trains in contemplating impermanence. While breathing in, he trains in contemplating fading away; while breathing out, he trains in contemplating fading away. While breathing in, he trains in contemplating cessation; while breathing out, he trains in contemplating cessation. While breathing in, he trains in contemplating relinquishment; while breathing out, he trains in contemplating relinquishment.</p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.389"></a>
Monks, when the <i lang="pi">samādhi</i> by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated in this way, it is peaceful and sublime, an exalted state of happiness, and it stops and settles bad, unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise."</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">15</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.3.1.4"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.390"></a>
And in this connection the Master
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.123"></a>
 convened the Sangha of monks and questioned the monks:<br>
<br>"Monks, is it true that some monks have taken their own lives, have killed one another, and have said to Migalaṇḍika, ʻFriend, please kill us. This bowl and robe will be yoursʼ?"<br>
<br>"It is true, Master."<br>
<br>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: "Monks, it is not suitable for these monks, it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it should not be done. How could those monks take their own lives … and say … ‘ … This bowl and robe will be yours’? It will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>

<p class="subrule"><span class="parno">16</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.391"></a>
If a monk intentionally kills a human being or searches for someone to kill him, he too is expelled and not in communion."</p>
<hr>
<p class="end"><span class="parno">17</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.392"></a>
Thus the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">18</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.3.2"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.393"></a>
At one time a certain lay-follower was ill. His wife was beautiful and pleasant, and the group of six monks had fallen in love with her. Then those monks said to each other: "Friends, if this
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.72"></a>
 lay-follower lives, we wonʼt get this woman. Come, let us praise the beauty of death to him." So they went to that lay follower and said:<br>
<br>
"Friend, you have done what is good and wholesome; you have made a <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.124"></a>
shelter from fear. You have not done anything bad; you have not been greedy and immoral. What need have you of this wretched, difficult life? Death is better for you than life. When you have passed away, at the breaking up of the body after death, you will be reborn in a happy destination, in a heaven world. There you will amuse yourself and enjoy the five types of heavenly sensual pleasures."</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">19</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.394"></a>
Then that lay-follower thought, "The Masters have spoken the truth, for I have done what is good and avoided what is bad, and after death I will be reborn in a happy destination."<br>
<br>He ate various types of detrimental food, he drank detrimental drinks, and because of this he became seriously ill and died.<br>
<br>
His wife criticised and denounced them: "These <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.125"></a>
recluses, the sons of the Sakyan, are shameless, immoral, liars. They claim to be followers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, of just conduct, committed to the spiritual life, speakers of truth, virtuous, of good conduct. But there is no recluseship or brahminhood among these—it is lost to them. Where is recluseship and brahminhood among them? They have departed from it. They praised the beauty of death to my husband. Because of them my husband has died."<br>
<br>And other people criticised and denounced them: "These recluses … Because of them that lay-follower has died.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">20</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.395"></a>
Monks heard the criticism of those people. Those monks who had few desires and a sense of shame, who were contented, scrupulous, and desirous of training ..
<p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.396"></a>
... criticised and denounced the group of six monks: "How could they praise the beauty of death to that lay-follower?" Then
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.73"></a>
 those monks informed the Master … <br>
<br>"Is it true, monks, that you praised the beauty of death to that lay-follower?"<br>
<br>"It is true, Master."<br>
<br>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: "Foolish men, it is not suitable, it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it should not be done. How could you praise the beauty of death to that lay-follower? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<strong>Final ruling</strong>

<hr>
<p class="rule"><span class="parno">22</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.397"></a>
"If a monk intentionally kills a human being or searches for someone to kill him or praises death or
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.126"></a>
 incites someone to die, saying, ‘Good man, what use to you is this wretched, difficult life? Death is better for you than life.’ If, thinking and intending thus, he praises death in various ways or incites someone to die, he too is expelled and not in communion."</p>
