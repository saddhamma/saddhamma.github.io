At one time the Awakened One, the Lord, was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan monastery. Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, she stood at a respectful distance. As she was standing at a respectful distance, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, spoke thus to the Lord:<br>
<br>
"Lord, it were well that women should obtain the going forth from home into homelessness in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder."<br>
<br>
"Be careful, Gotami, of the going forth of women from home into homelessness in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder."
</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
And a second time … And a third time did the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great speak thus to the Lord: "Lord, it were well … "<br>
<br>
"Be careful, Gotami, of the going forth of women from home into homelessness in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder."<br>
<br>
Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, thinking: "The Lord does not allow women to go forth from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder," afflicted, grieved, with a tearful face and crying, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping her right side towards him.</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.20.1.2" href="#Kd.20.1.2"></a>
Then the Lord having stayed at Kapilavatthu for as long as he found suiting, set out on tour for Vesālī. Gradually, walking on tour, he arrived at Vesālī. The Lord stayed there in Vesālī in the Great Grove in the Gabled Hall. Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, having had her hair cut off, having donned saffron robes, set out for Vesālī with several Sakyan women, and in due course approached Vesālī, the Great Grove, the Gabled Hall. Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust, with tearful face, and crying, stood outside the porch of the gateway.
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.353"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.254"></a>
 The venerable Ānanda saw the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, standing outside the porch of the gateway, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust, with tearful face and crying; seeing her, he spoke thus to the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great:<br>
<br>"Why are you, Gotami, standing … and crying?" <br>
<br>
"It is because, honoured Ānanda, the Lord does not allow the going forth of women from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder."<br>
<br>
"Well now, Gotami, stay here a moment, until I have asked the Lord for the going forth of women from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder."</p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.20.1.3" href="#Kd.20.1.3"></a>
Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord:<br>
<br>
"Lord, this Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, is standing outside the porch of the gateway, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust, with tearful face and crying, and saying that the Lord does not allow the going forth of women from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder. It were well, Lord, if women might obtain the going forth from home … by the Truth-finder."<br>
<br>"Be careful, Ānanda, of the going forth of women from home … by the Truth-finder." And a second time … And a third time the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord: "It were well, Lord, if women might obtain the going forth … proclaimed by the Truth-finder."
"Be careful, Ānanda, of the going forth of women from home into homelessness in the
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder."
</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Then the venerable Ānanda, thinking: ‘The Lord does not allow the going forth of women from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder. Suppose now that I, by some other method, should ask the Lord for the going forth of women
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.354"></a>
 from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder." Then the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord:<br>
<br>
"Now, Lord, are women, having gone forth from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder, able to realise the fruit of stream-attainment or the fruit of once-returning or the fruit of non-returning or perfection?"<br>
<br>"Women, Ānanda, having gone forth … are able to realise … perfection."<br>
<br>
"If, Lord, women, having gone forth … are able to realise … perfection—and, Lord, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, was of great service: she was the Lord’s aunt, <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.255"></a>
foster-mother, nurse, giver of milk, for when the Lord’s mother passed away she suckled him—it were well, Lord, that women should obtain the going forth from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder."</p>

<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.20.1.4" href="#Kd.20.1.4"></a>
"If, Ānanda, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, accepts eight important rules, that may be ordination for her:</p>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
"A nun who has been ordained (even) for a century must greet respectfully, rise up from her seat, salute with joined palms, do proper homage to a monk ordained but that day. And this rule is to be honoured, respected, revered, venerated, never to be transgressed during her life.</p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
"A nun must not spend the rains in a residence where there is no monk. This rule too is to be honoured … during her life.</p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
"Every half month a nun should desire two things from the Order of monks: the asking (as to the date) of the Observance day, and the coming for the exhortation. This rule too is to be honoured … during her life.</p>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>"After the rains a nun must ‘invite’ before both Orders in respect of three matters: what was seen, what was heard, what was suspected. This rule too is to be honoured … during her life.</p>

<p><span class="parno">11</span> <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.355"></a>
 "A nun, offending against an important rule, must undergo <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> (discipline) for half a month before both Orders. This rule too must be honoured … during her life.</p>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>"When, as a probationer, she has trained in the six rules for two years, she should seek ordination from both Orders. This rule too is to be honoured … during her life.</p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>"A monk must not be abused or reviled in any way by a nun. This rule too is to be honoured … during her life.</p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>"From to-day admonition of monks by nuns is forbidden, admonition of nuns by monks is not forbidden. This rule too is to be honoured, respected, revered, venerated, never to be transgressed during her life.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">16-24</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.20.1.5" href="#Kd.20.1.5"></a>
Then the venerable Ānanda, having learnt the eight important rules from the Lord, approached the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great; having approached, he spoke thus to the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great:<br>
<br>"If you, Gotami, will accept eight important rules, that will be the ordination for you: a nun who has been ordained (even) for a century … From to-day admonition of monks by nuns is forbidden … never to be transgressed during your life.
<p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">25</span>If you, Gotami, will accept these eight important rules, that will be the ordination for you."</p>

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
"Even, honoured Ānanda, as a woman or a man when young, of tender years, and fond of ornaments, having washed (himself and his) head, <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.256"></a>
having obtained a garland of lotus flowers or a garland of jasmine flowers or a garland of some sweet-scented creeper, having taken it with both hands, should place it on top of his head—even so do I, honoured Ananda, accept these eight important rules never to be transgressed during my life."</p>

<p><span class="parno">27</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.20.1.6" href="#Kd.20.1.6"></a>
Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Lord: having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, the eight important rules were accepted by the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great."</p>

<p><span class="parno">28</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.356"></a>
"If, Ānanda, women had not obtained the going forth from home into homelessness in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder, the Brahma-faring, Ānanda, would have lasted long, true <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> would have endured for a thousand years. But since, Ānanda, women have gone forth … in the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder, now, Ānanda, the Brahma-faring will not last long, true <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> will endure only for five hundred years.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
"Even, Ānanda, as those households which have many women and few men easily fall a prey to robbers, to pot-thieves, even so, Ānanda in whatever <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline women obtain the going forth from home into homelessness, that Brahma-faring will not last long.</p>

<p><span class="parno">30</span>
"Even, Ānanda, as when the disease known as mildew attacks a whole field of rice that field of rice does not last long, even so, Ānanda, in whatever <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline women obtain the going forth … that Brahma-faring will not last long.</p>

<p><span class="parno">31</span>
"Even, Ānanda, as when the disease known as red rust attacks a whole field of sugar-cane, that field of sugar-cane does not last long, even so, Ānanda, in whatever <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline … that Brahma-faring will not last long.</p>

<p><span class="parno">32</span>"Even, Ānanda, as a man, looking forward, may build a dyke to a great reservoir so that the water may not overflow, even so, Ānanda, were the eight important rules for nuns laid down by me, looking forward, not to be transgressed during their life."</p>

<br>
"Now, what line of conduct, Lord, should I follow in regard to these
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.257"></a>
 Sakyan women?" Then the Lord, gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, gladdened … delighted by the Lord with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping her right side towards him. Then the Lord on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>
<br>
"<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, nuns to be ordained by monks.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="parno">35</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.20.2.2" href="#Kd.20.2.2"></a>
Then these nuns spoke thus to the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great: "The lady is not-ordained, neither are we ordained, for it was thus laid down by the Lord: nuns should be ordained by monks."<br>
<br>Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great approached the venerable Ānanda; having approached, having greeted the venerable Ānanda, she stood at a respectful distance. As she was standing at a respectful distance, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda: "Honoured Ānanda, these nuns spoke to me thus: ‘The lady is not ordained, neither are we ordained, for it was thus laid down by the Lord: nuns should be ordained by monks’."</p>

<p><span class="parno">36</span>Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus: ‘Honoured Ananda, these nuns spoke to me thus … nuns should be ordained by monks’."</p>

<p><span class="parno">37</span>"At the time, Ānanda, when the eight important rules were accepted by the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great, that was her ordination."</p>

Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great approached the venerable Ānanda; having approached, having greeted the venerable Ānanda, she stood at a respectful distance. As she was standing at a respectful distance, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda: "I, honoured Ānanda, am asking one boon from the Lord: It were well,
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.358"></a>
 Lord, if the Lord would allow greeting, standing up for salutation and the proper duties between monks and nuns according to seniority."</p>

<p><span class="parno">39</span>Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus: ‘I, honoured Ānanda, am asking one boon … according to seniority’."</p>

<p><span class="parno">40</span>
"This is impossible, Ānanda, <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.258"></a>
it cannot come to pass, that the Truth-finder should allow greeting, standing up for, salutation and the proper duties between monks and nuns according to seniority. Ānanda, these followers of other sects, although liable to poor guardianship, will not carry out greeting, standing up for, salutation and proper duties towards women, so how should the Truth-finder allow greeting … and proper duties towards women?" Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">41</span>
"<span class="rule">Monks, one should not carry out greeting, rising up for salutation and proper duties towards women. Whoever should carry out (one of these), there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>"<br>

Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, she stood at a respectful distance. As she was standing at a respectful distance, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, those rules of training for nuns which are in common with those for monks, what line of conduct should we, Lord, follow in regard to these rules of training?"<br>
<br>"Those rules of training for nuns, Gotami, which are in common with those for monks, as the monks train themselves, so should you train yourselves in these rules of training."<br>
<br>"Those rules of training for nuns, Lord, which are not in common with those for monks, what line of conduct should we, Lord, follow in regard to these rules of training?"<br>

Then the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, she stood at a respectful distance. As she was standing at a respectful distance, the Gotamid, Pajāpatī the Great spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, it were well if the Lord would teach me <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> in brief so that I, having heard the Lord’s <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, might live alone, aloof, zealous, ardent, self-resolute."<br>
<br>
"Whatever are the states, of which you, Gotami, may know: these states lead to passion, not to passionlessness, they lead to bondage, not to the absence of bondage, they lead to the piling up (of rebirth), not to the absence of piling up, they lead to wanting much, not to wanting little, they lead to discontent, not to contentment, they lead to sociability, not to solitude, they lead to indolence, not to the putting forth of energy,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.259"></a>
they lead to difficulty in supporting oneself, not to ease in supporting oneself—you should know definitely, Gotami: this is not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, this is not discipline, this is not the Teacher’s instruction. But whatever are the states of which you, Gotami, may know: these states lead to passionlessness, not to passion …
<span class="add"><em>the opposite of the preceding</em></span> … they lead to ease in supporting oneself, not to difficulty in supporting oneself—you should know definitely, Gotami: this is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, this is discipline, this is the Teacher’s instruction."<br>

<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.20.6.1" href="#Kd.20.6.1"></a>
Now at that time the Pātimokkha was not recited to nuns. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to recite the Pātimokkha to the nuns.</span>" Then it occurred to the nuns: "Now, by whom should the Pātimokkha be recited to nuns?" They told this matter to the Lord.
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.360"></a>
 He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow monks, the Pātimokkha to be recited to nuns by monks.</span>"<br>
<br>

<p><span class="parno">45</span>Now at that time monks, having approached a nunnery, recited the Pātimokkha to nuns. People looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "These are their wives, these are their mistresses; now they will take their pleasure together." Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>

<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, the Pātimokkha to be recited to nuns by nuns.</span>"<br>
<br>
The nuns did not know how to recite the Pātimokkha. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to explain to the nuns through monks, saying: ‘The Pātimokkha should be recited thus’.</span>"<br>

<p><span class="parno">46</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.20.6.2" href="#Kd.20.6.2"></a>
Now at that time nuns did not confess offences. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="rule">Monks, an offence should not be not confessed by a nun.

Then it occurred to monks: "Now, by whom should nuns’ offences be acknowledged?" They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks to acknowledge nuns’ offences through monks.</span>"<br>

<p><span class="parno">47</span>
Now at that time nuns, having (each) seen a monk on a carriage-road and in a cul-de-sac and at cross-roads, having (each) laid down her bowl on the ground, having arranged her upper robe over one shoulder, having sat down on her haunches, having saluted with joined palms, confessed an offence. People … spread it about, saying: "These are their wives, these are their mistresses; having treated them

contemptuously during the night now they are asking for forgiveness." They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="rule">Monks, nuns’ offences should not be acknowledged by monks. Whoever should acknowledge (one), there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, nuns’ offences to be acknowledged by nuns.</span>" The nuns did not know how to acknowledge offences. They told this matter to the Lord.
