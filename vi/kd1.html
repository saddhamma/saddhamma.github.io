At one time the awakened one, the Lord, being recently fully awakened, was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the river Nerañjarā at the foot of the Tree of Awakening. Then the Lord sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at the foot of the Tree of Awakening experiencing the bliss of freedom. Then the Lord during the first watch of the night paid attention to causal uprising in direct and reverse order:</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.1.2" href="#Kd.1.1.2"></a>Conditioned by ignorance are the habitual tendencies; conditioned by the habitual tendencies is consciousness; conditioned by consciousness is psycho-physicality; conditioned by psycho-physicality are the six (sense-) spheres; conditioned by the six (sense-) spheres is awareness; conditioned by awareness is feeling; conditioned by feeling is craving; conditioned by craving is grasping; conditioned by grasping is becoming; conditioned by becoming is birth; conditioned by birth, old age and dying, grief, sorrow and lamentation, suffering, dejection and despair come into being. Such is the arising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.2" href="#BD.4.2"></a>
But from the utter fading away and stopping of this very ignorance (comes) the stopping of habitual tendencies; from the stopping of habitual tendencies the stopping of consciousness; from the stopping of consciousness the stopping of psycho-physicality; from the stopping of psycho-physicality the stopping of the six (sense-) spheres; from the stopping of the six (sense-) spheres the stopping of awareness; from the stopping of awareness the stopping of feeling; from the stopping of feeling the stopping of craving; from the stopping of craving the stopping of grasping; from the stopping of grasping the stopping of becoming; from the stopping of becoming the stopping of birth; from the stopping of birth, old age and dying, grief, sorrow and lamentation, suffering, dejection and despair are stopped. Such is the stopping of this entire mass of ill.

<p><span class="parno">11</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.1.7" href="#Kd.1.1.7"></a>

Then the Lord, having emerged from that contemplation at the end of seven days, approached the Goatherds’ Banyan from the foot of the Tree of Awakening; having approached, he sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at the foot of the Goatherds’ Banyan experiencing the bliss of freedom.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.2.2" href="#Kd.1.2.2"></a>
Then a certain brahman of the class uttering the sound <i lang="pi">huṃ</i> approached the Lord; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Lord; having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy, he stood at a respectful distance. As he was standing at a respectful distance, that brahman
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.3" href="#Vin.1.3"></a>
 spoke thus to the Lord: "To what extent, good Gotama, does one become a brahman? And again, what are the things which make a brahman?"<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.2.3" href="#Kd.1.2.3"></a>

"That brahman who bars out evil things, <br>
not uttering the sound <i lang="pi">hum</i>, <br>
with no impurity, curbed-of-self,<br>
Master of Vedas, who lives the Brahma-faring—<br>
this is the brahman who may rightly speak the Brahma-speech<br>
Who has no blemishes anywhere in the world."

<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.3.1" href="#Kd.1.3.1"></a>
Then the Lord, at the end of seven days, having emerged from that contemplation, approached the Mucalinda (tree) from the foot of the Goatherds’ Banyan; having approached, he sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at the foot of the Mucalinda experiencing the bliss of freedom.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.3.2" href="#Kd.1.3.2"></a>
Now at that time a great storm arose out of due season, for seven days there was rainy weather, cold winds and overcast skies. Then Mucalinda, the serpent king, having come forth from his own haunt, having encircled the Lord’s body seven times with his coils, having spread a great hood over his head, stood saying: "Let no cold (annoy) the Lord, let no heat (annoy) the Lord, let not the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind and heat or creeping things (annoy) the Lord."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.3.3" href="#Kd.1.3.3"></a>
Then Mucalinda, the serpent king, at the end of those seven days, having known that the sky was clear and without a cloud, having unwound his coils from the Lord’s body, having given up his own form and assumed a youth’s form, stood in front of the Lord honouring the Lord with joined palms. <br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.3.4" href="#Kd.1.3.4"></a>
Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this (solemn) utterance:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">18</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.5" href="#BD.4.5"></a>
"Happy his solitude who glad at heart <br>
Hath <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> learnt and doth the vision see!<br>
Happy is that benignity towards<br>
The world which on no creature worketh harm.</p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>Happy the absence of all lust, th’ ascent <br>
Past and beyond the needs of sense-desires.<br>

<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.4.1" href="#Kd.1.4.1"></a>
Then the Lord, at the end of seven days, having emerged from that contemplation, approached the Rājāyata from the foot of the Mucalinda; having approached, he sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at the foot of the Rājāyatana experiencing the bliss of freedom.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.4.2" href="#Kd.1.4.2"></a>
Now<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.4" href="#Vin.1.4"></a> at that time the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika were going along the high-road from Ukkalā to that district. Then a <i lang="pi">devatā</i> who was a blood-relation of the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika spoke thus to the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika: "My good fellows, this Lord, having just (become) wholly awakened, is staying at the foot of the Rājāyatana, go and serve that Lord with barley-gruel and honey-balls, and this will be a blessing and happiness for you for a long time."</p>

<p><span class="parno">22</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.4.3" href="#Kd.1.4.3"></a>
Then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, taking barley-gruel and honey-balls, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they stood at a respectful distance. As they were standing at a respectful distance, the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, let the Lord receive our barley-gruel and honey-balls, that this may be a blessing and happiness for us for a long time."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.4.4" href="#Kd.1.4.4"></a>
Then it occurred to the Lord: "Truth-finders do not <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.6" href="#BD.4.6"></a>
 receive with their hands. Now with what shall I receive the barley-gruel and honey-balls?" Then the four Great Kings, knowing with their minds the reasoning in the Lord’s mind, from the four quarters presented the Lord with four bowls made of rock crystal, saying: "Lord, let the Lord receive the barley-gruel and honey-balls herein." The Lord received the barley-gruel and the honey-balls in a new bowl made of rock crystal, and having received them he partook of them.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">23</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.4.5" href="#Kd.1.4.5"></a>
Then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, having found that the Lord had removed his hand from the bowl, having inclined their heads towards the Lord’s feet, spoke thus to the Lord: "We, Lord, are those going to the Lord for refuge and to <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>; let the Lord accept us as lay-disciples gone for refuge for life from this day forth." Thus these came to be the first lay-disciples in the world using the two-word formula.</p>
<p class="end"><span class="parno">24</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.4.6" href="#Kd.1.4.6"></a>

<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5.1" href="#Kd.1.5.1"></a>
Then the Lord, having emerged from that contemplation at the end of seven days, approached the Goatherds’ Banyan from the foot of the Rājāyatana; having approached, the Lord stayed there at the foot of the Goatherds’ Banyan.<br>
<br>
Then as the Lord was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind thus: "This <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, won to by me, is deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful, excellent, beyond dialectic, subtle, intelligible to the learned. But this is a creation delighting in sensual pleasure, delighted by sensual pleasure, rejoicing in sensual pleasure. So that for a creation delighting in sensual pleasure, delighted by sensual pleasure, rejoicing in sensual pleasure, this were a matter difficult to see,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.5" href="#Vin.1.5"></a>
 that is to say causal uprising by way of
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.7" href="#BD.4.7"></a>
 cause. This too were a matter very difficult to see, that is to say the calming of all the habitual tendencies, the renunciation of all attachment, the destruction of craving, dispassion, stopping, <i lang="pi">nibbāna</i>. And so if I were to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and others were not to understand me, this would be a weariness to me, this would be a vexation to me."<br>
<br>
And further, these verses not heard before in the past occurred spontaneously to the Lord:<br>

<hr>
<blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
"This that through many toils I’ve won—<br>
Enough! Why should I make it known?<br>
By folk with lust and hate consumed<br>
This <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> is not understood.</p>

<p><span class="parno">27</span>
Leading on against the stream,<br>
Subtle, deep, difficult to see, delicate,<br>
Unseen ‘twill be by passion’s slaves<br>
Cloaked in the murk of ignorance."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">28</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5.4" href="#Kd.1.5.4"></a>
In such wise, as the Lord pondered, his mind inclined to little effort and not to teaching <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.</p>

<p><span class="parno">29</span>Then it occurred to Brahmā Sahampati, knowing with his mind the reasoning in the Lord’s mind: "Alas, the world is lost, alas, the world is destroyed, inasmuch as the mind of the Truth-finder, the perfected one, the fully awakened one, inclines to little effort and not to teaching <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>."<br>
<br>
Then as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm or might bend back his outstretched arm, even so did Brahmā Sahampati, vanishing from the Brahma-world, become manifest before the Lord.<br>
<br>
Then Brahmā Sahampati, having arranged his upper robe
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.8" href="#BD.4.8"></a>
 over one shoulder, having stooped his right knee to the ground having saluted the Lord with joined palms, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, let the Lord teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, let the Well-farer teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>; there are beings with little dust in their eyes who, not hearing <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, are decaying, (but if) they are learners of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, they will grow."<br>
<br>
Thus spoke Brahmā Sahampati; having said this, he further spoke thus:<br>

<hr>
<blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">30</span>
"There has appeared in Magadha before thee<br>
An unclean <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> by impure minds devised. <br>
Open this door of deathlessness, let them hear<br>
<i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> awakened to by the stainless one.</p>

<p><span class="parno">31</span>
"As on a crag on crest of mountain standing
<br>
A man might watch the people far below,<br>
E’en so do thou, O Wisdom fair, ascending,<br>
O Seer of all, the terraced heights of truth,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.6" href="#Vin.1.6"></a>
<br>
Look down, from grief released, upon the peoples<br>
Sunken in grief, oppressed with birth and age.</p>

<p><span class="parno">32</span>
"Arise, thou hero! Conqueror in the battle!<br>
Thou freed from debt! Man of the caravan!<br>
Walk the world over, let the Blessed One<br>
Teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. They who learn will grow."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">33-36</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5.8" href="#Kd.1.5.8"></a>
When he had spoken thus, the Lord spoke thus to Brahmā Sahampati: "Brahmā, it occurred to me: ‘This <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> penetrated by me is deep … that would be a vexation to me.’ And further, Brahmā, these verses not heard before in the past occurred spontaneously to me: ‘This that through many toils I’ve won … cloaked in the murk of ignorance.’ In such wise, Brahmā, as I pondered, my mind inclined to little effort and not to teaching <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>."</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">37-44</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5.9" href="#Kd.1.5.9"></a>
Then a second time did Brahmā Sahampati speak thus to the Lord: "Lord, let the Lord teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … if they are
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.9" href="#BD.4.9"></a>
 learners of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, they will grow." Then a second time did the Lord speak thus to Brahmā Sahampati: "But, Brahmā, it occurred to me: … my mind inclined to little effort and and not to teaching <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>."</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">45-48</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5.10" href="#Kd.1.5.10"></a>
Then a third time did Brahmā Sahampati speak thus to the Lord: "Lord, let the Lord teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … if they are learners of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, they will grow."</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">49</span>Then the Lord, having understood Brahmā’s entreaty and, out of compassion for beings, surveyed the world with the eye of an awakened one. As the Lord was surveying the world with the eye of an awakened one, he saw beings with little dust in their eyes, with much dust in their eyes, with acute faculties, with dull faculties, of good dispositions, of bad dispositions, docile, indocile, few seeing fear in sins and the worlds beyond.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5.11" href="#Kd.1.5.11"></a>
Even as in a pond of blue lotuses or in a pond of red lotuses or in a pond of white lotuses, a few blue or red or white lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water, do not rise above the water but thrive while altogether immersed; a few blue or red or white lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water and reach to the surface of the water; a few blue or red or white lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water, and stand up rising out of the water, undefiled by the water.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.1.12" href="#Kd.1.1.12"></a>
Even so, did the Lord, surveying the world with the eye of an awakened one, see beings with little dust in their eyes, with much dust in their eyes,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.7" href="#Vin.1.7"></a>
 with acute faculties, with dull faculties, of good dispositions, of bad dispositions, docile, indocile, few seeing fear in sins and the worlds beyond. Seeing Brahmā Sahampati, he addressed him with verses:</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">50</span>
"Open for those who hear are the doors of deathlessness;<br>
let them renounce their faith.<br>
Thinking of useless fatigue, I have not preached, Brahmā, the<br>
sublime and excellent <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to men."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">51</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5.13" href="#Kd.1.5.13"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.10"></a>
Then Brahmā Sahampati, thinking: "The opportunity was made by me for the Lord to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>," greeting the Lord, keeping his right side towards him, vanished then and there.</p>
<p class="end"><span class="parno">52</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.5.14" href="#Kd.1.5.14"></a>
Told is the Talk on Brahmā’s Entreaty.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">53</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.1" href="#Kd.1.6.1"></a>
Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now, to whom should I first teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>? Who will understand this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> quickly?" Then it occurred to the Lord: "Indeed, this Āḷāra the Kālāma is learned, experienced, wise, and for a long time has had little dust in his eyes. Suppose I were to teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> first to Āḷāra the Kālāma? He will understand this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> quickly."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.2" href="#Kd.1.6.2"></a>
But then an invisible <i lang="pi">devatā</i> announced to the Lord: "Lord, Āḷāra the Kālāma passed away seven days ago." And the knowledge arose to the Lord that Āḷāra the Kālāma had passed away seven days ago. Then it occurred to the Lord: "Āḷāra the Kālāma was of great intelligence.

<p><span class="parno">54</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.3" href="#Kd.1.6.3"></a>
Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now, to whom should I first teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>? Who will understand this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> quickly?" Then it occurred to the Lord: "Indeed, this Uddaka, Rāma’s son, is learned, experienced, wise, and for a long time has had little dust in his eyes.

<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.6" href="#Kd.1.6.6"></a>
Then it occurred to the Lord: "But where is this group of five monks staying at present? Then the Lord with

<p><span class="parno">56</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.7" href="#Kd.1.6.7"></a>
Upaka, a Naked Ascetic, saw the Lord going along the highroad between Gayā and the (Tree of) Awakening; seeing him, he spoke thus to the Lord: "Your reverence, your sense-organs are quite pure, your complexion very bright, very clear. On account of whom have you, your reverence, gone forth, or who is your teacher, or whose <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> do you profess?"<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.8" href="#Kd.1.6.8"></a>
When this had been said, the Lord addressed Upaka, the Naked Ascetic, in verses:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">57</span>
"Victorious over all, omniscient am I,<br>

<p><span class="parno">58</span>
For me there is no teacher,<br>

In the world with its <i lang="pi">devas</i><br>
No one equals me.</p>

<p><span class="parno">59</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.12"></a>
For I am perfected in the world,<br>

<p><span class="parno">60</span>
To turn the <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-wheel<br>
I go to Kasi’s city,<br>

<p><span class="parno">61</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.9" href="#Kd.1.6.9"></a>
"According to what you claim, your reverence, you ought to be victor of the unending" (Upaka said).</p>

<p><span class="parno">62</span>
"Like me, they are victors indeed,<br>

<p><span class="parno">63</span>When this had been said, Upaka, the Naked Ascetic, having said, "It may be (so), your reverence," having shaken his head, went off taking a different road.</p>

Then the Lord, walking on tour, in due course approached Benares, the deer-park of Isipatana, the group of five monks. The group of five monks saw the Lord coming in the distance; seeing him, they agreed among themselves, saying: "Your reverences, this recluse Gotama is coming, he lives in abundance,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.9" href="#Vin.1.9"></a>
 he is wavering in his striving, he has reverted to a life of abundance. He should neither be greeted, nor stood up for, nor should his bowl and robe be received; all the same a seat may be put out, he can sit down if he wants to."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.11" href="#Kd.1.6.11"></a>
But as the Lord gradually approached this group of five monks, so this group of five monks, not adhering to their own agreement, having gone towards the Lord, one received his bowl and robe, one made ready a seat, one brought water for washing the feet, a foot-stool, a foot-stand. The Lord sat down on the seat made ready, and the Lord, while he was sitting down, washed his feet. Further, they addressed the Lord by name and with the epithet of "your reverence."</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">65</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.6.12" href="#Kd.1.6.12"></a>
When this had been said, the Lord spoke thus to the group of five monks: "Do not, monks, address a Truthfinder by name, and with the epithet ‘your reverence’. A Truthfinder, monks, is a perfected one, a fully awakened one. Give ear, monks, the deathless has been found;

Going along in accordance with what has been enjoined, having soon realised here and now by your own super-knowledge that supreme goal of the Brahma-faring for the sake of which young men of family rightly go forth from home into homelessness, you will abide in it."<br>
<br>
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.14"></a>
When this had been said, the group of five monks spoke thus to the Lord: "But you, reverend Gotama, did not come to a state of further-men, to the eminence of truly <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> vision of knowledge, by this conduct, by this course, by this practice of austerities. So how can you now come to a state of further-men, to the eminence of the truly <i lang="pi">ariyan</i> vision of knowledge, when you live in abundance, are wavering in striving, and have reverted to a life of abundance?"<br>
<br>
When this had been said, the Lord spoke thus to the group of five monks: "A Truthfinder, monks, does not live in abundance, he does not waver in striving, he does not revert to a life of abundance. A Truthfinder, monks, is a perfected one, a fully awakened one. Give ear, monks, the deathless has been found;

And a second time did the group of five monks speak thus to the Lord … And a second time did the Lord speak thus to the group of five monks … And a third time did the group of five monks speak thus to the Lord:

<br>"You have not, Lord."<br>
<br>"A Truthfinder, monks, is a perfected one, a fully awakened one. Give ear … you will abide in it." And the Lord was able to convince the group of five monks. Then the group of five monks listened to the Lord again, gave ear to him and aroused their minds for profound knowledge.</p>

Then the Lord addressed the group of five monks, saying:</p>

Then while Yasa, the young man of family, was possessed of and provided with the five kinds of sense-pleasures, and was being ministered to, he fell asleep first and his suite fell asleep after him, and an oil lamp was burning all through the night.<br>
<br>
Then Yasa, the young man of family, having awoken first saw his own suite sleeping, one with a lute in the hollow of her arm, one with a tabor at her neck, one with a drum in the hollow of her arm, one with dishevelled hair, one with saliva dripping from her mouth, muttering in their sleep, like a cemetery before his very eyes. Seeing this, its peril grew plain, and his mind was set on disregarding it. Then Yasa, the young man of family, uttered a solemn utterance: "What distress indeed, what affliction indeed."</p>

<p><span class="parno">108</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.3" href="#Kd.1.7.3"></a>
Then Yasa, the young man of family, having put on his golden sandals, approached the door of the dwelling. Non-human beings opened the door, thinking: "Let there be no obstacle for the going forth from home into homelessness of Yasa, the young man of family." Then Yasa, the young man of family, approached the city-door. Non-human beings opened the door, thinking: "Let there be no obstacle for the going forth from home into homelessness of Yasa, the young man of family." Then Yasa, the young man of family, approached the deer-park at Isipatana.</p>

<p><span class="parno">109</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.4" href="#Kd.1.7.4"></a>
At that time, the Lord having risen in the night towards dawn, was pacing up and down in the open air. The Lord saw Yasa, the young man of family, coming in the distance: seeing him, having come down from (the place) where he was pacing up and down, he sat down on an appointed seat. Then Yasa, the young man of family, when he was near, uttered this solemn utterance to the Lord: "What distress indeed, what affliction
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.23"></a>
 indeed." Then the Lord spoke thus to Yasa, the young man of family: "This, Yasa, is not distress, this, Yasa, is not affliction. Come, sit down, Yasa, I will teach you <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>."<br>
<br>Then Yasa, the young man of family, thinking: "It is said that this is not distress, that this is not affliction", exultant and uplifted, having taken off his golden sandals, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

<p><span class="parno">110</span>As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the Lord talked a progressive talk to Yasa, the young man of family, that is to say, talk on giving, talk on moral habit, talk on heaven, he explained the peril, the vanity, the depravity of pleasures of the senses, the advantage in renouncing them.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.6" href="#Kd.1.7.6"></a>
When the Lord
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.16"></a>
 knew that the mind of Yasa, the young man of family, was ready, malleable, devoid of hindrances, uplifted, pleased, then he explained to him the teaching on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> which the awakened ones have themselves discovered: ill, uprising, stopping, the Way. And just as a clean cloth without black specks will take a dye easily, even so (as he was sitting) on that very seat, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to Yasa, the young man of family, that whatever is of a nature to uprise, all that is of a nature to stop."</p>

<p><span class="parno">111</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.7" href="#Kd.1.7.7"></a>
Then the mother of Yasa, the young man of family, having mounted up to the mansion, not seeing Yasa, the young man of family, approached the (great) merchant, the householder; having approached she spoke thus to the (great) merchant, the householder; "Householder, your son, Yasa, is not to be seen." Then the (great) merchant, the householder, having dispatched messengers on horse-back to the four quarters, himself approached the deer-park at Isipatana. The (great) merchant, the householder, saw the prints of golden sandals, and seeing them he followed them along.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.8" href="#Kd.1.7.8"></a>
The Lord saw the (great) merchant, the householder, coming
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.24"></a>
 in the distance; seeing him, it occurred to the Lord: "Suppose I were to perform such a psychic wonder that the (great) merchant, the householder, sitting here, should not see Yasa the young man of family, sitting here?" Then the Lord performed such a psychic wonder.</p>

<p><span class="parno">112</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.9" href="#Kd.1.7.9"></a>
Then the (great) merchant, the householder, approached the Lord; having approached he spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord has the Lord not seen Yasa, the young man of family?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">113</span>"Well, householder, sit down. Perhaps, sitting here, you may see Yasa, the young man of family, sitting here."<br>
<br>Then the (great) merchant, the householder, thinking: "It is said that I, sitting here, will see Yasa, the young man of family, sitting here", and exultant, uplifted, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">114-115</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.10" href="#Kd.1.7.10"></a>
As the (great) merchant, the householder was sitting down at a respectful distance, the Lord talked a progressive talk … attained without the help of another to full confidence in the teacher’s instruction, spoke thus to the Lord: "Excellent, Lord! Excellent, Lord! Just as one might set upright what has been upset, or might uncover what was concealed, or might show the way to one who is astray, or might bring an oil lamp into the darkness, thinking, ‘Those with eyes may see shapes’, even so is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> explained in many a figure by the Lord. I myself go to the Lord as refuge, to <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, and to the Order of monks. Let the Lord accept me as a lay-disciple gone for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts." Thus he came to be the first lay-disciple in the world
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.17"></a>
 using the three-word formula.</p>

<p><span class="parno">116</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.11" href="#Kd.1.7.11"></a>
Then while the father of Yasa, the young man of family, was being taught <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, as he was reviewing his stage (of knowledge) as it was seen, as it was known, his mind was freed from the cankers without grasping. Then it occurred to the Lord: "While the father of Yasa, the young man of family, was being taught <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, as he was reviewing his stage (of knowledge) as it was seen, as it was known, his mind was freed from the cankers without grasping. Now Yasa, the
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.25"></a>
 young man of family, cannot become one, having turned back to the low life, to enjoy pleasures of the senses as he did formerly when leading a household life. Suppose I were to annul that psychic wonder?" Then the Lord annulled that psychic wonder.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">117</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.12" href="#Kd.1.7.12"></a>
Then the (great) merchant, the householder, saw Yasa, the young man of family sitting down; seeing him, he spoke thus to Yasa, the young man of family: "Dear Yasa, your mother is full of lamentation and grief, give your mother life."<br>
<br>
Then Yasa, the young man of family, looked towards the Lord. Then the Lord spoke thus to the (great) merchant, the householder: "What do you think about this, house-holder, that <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> was seen by Yasa with a learner’s knowledge, with a learner’s insight, even as by you? As he was reviewing his stage (of knowledge), as it was seen, as it was known, his mind was freed from the cankers without grasping. Now can Yasa, householder, having turned back to the low life, become one to enjoy pleasures of the senses, as he did formerly when leading a household life?"<br>
<br>"No, Lord."<br>
<br>
"<i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> was seen by Yasa, the young man of family, householder, with a learner’s knowledge, with a learner’s insight, even as by you. As he was reviewing his stage (of knowledge), as it was seen, as it was known, his mind was freed from the cankers without grasping. Now Yasa, the young man of family, householder, cannot become one, having turned back to the low life, to enjoy pleasures of the senses, as he did formerly when leading a household life."<br>
<br>
"Lord, it is a gain for Yasa, the young man of family, Lord, it is well gotten for Yasa, the young man of family, inasmuch as the mind of Yasa, the young man of family, is freed from the cankers without grasping. Lord, may the Lord consent to a meal with me on the morrow with Yasa, the young man of family, as his attendant?" The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

<p><span class="parno">118</span>Then the (great) merchant, the householder, knowing that the Lord had consented, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.7.15" href="#Kd.1.7.15"></a>
Then Yasa, the young man of family, soon after the (great)

 merchant, the householder, had departed, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, may I receive the going forth in the Lord’s presence, may I receive ordination?"<br>
<br>
"Come, monk," the Lord said, "well preached is
<i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Lead the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill." So this

Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached the dwelling of the (great) merchant, the householder, with the venerable Yasa as attendant; having approached, he sat down on an appointed seat. Then the mother and the former wife of the venerable Yasa approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

These, having seen <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, attained <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> … spoke thus to the Lord: "Excellent Lord! … we ourselves, Lord, go to the Lord as refuge, to <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and to the Order of monks.

Then the venerable Yasa’s mother and father and former wife, having with their own hand(s) served the Lord and the venerable Yasa and having offered them sumptuous foods, solid and soft, sat down when the Lord had finished his meal and had removed his hand from the bowl.

 Subāhu, Puṇṇaji, Gavampati, heard: "They say that Yasa, the young man of family, having cut off his hair and beard, having put on yellow robes, has gone forth from home into homelessness." Having heard this, it occurred to them: "Now this can be no ordinary <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline, nor can this be an ordinary going forth, in that Yasa, the young man of family, having cut off his hair and beard, having put on the yellow robes, has gone forth from home into homelessness."</p>

<br>
"Come, monks," the Lord said, "well taught is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill." So this came to be these venerable ones’ ordination.</p>

<p><span class="parno">155</span>
Then the Lord, walking on tour, in due course arrived at Uruvelā. Now at that time three matted hair ascetics, Kassapa of Uruvelā, Kassapa of the River, Kassapa of Gayā, were living at Uruvelā. Of these, the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā was leader, guide, highest, chief, head of <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.33"></a>
five hundred matted hair ascetics; the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of the River was leader … head of three hundred matted hair ascetics; the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Gayā was leader … head of two hundred matted hair ascetics.</p>

<p><span class="parno">156</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.15.2" href="#Kd.1.15.2"></a>
Then the Lord approached the hermitage of the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā; having approached, he spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā: "If it is not inconvenient to you, Kassapa, let me stay for one night in the fire-room."<br>
<br>"It is not inconvenient to me, great recluse, (but) there is a fierce serpent king of psychic power there; he is a terribly venomous snake. Do not let him harm you."</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">157</span>And a second time the Lord spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā: "If it is not inconvenient to you … "</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">158</span>And a third time the Lord spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā: "If it is not inconvenient to you, Kassapa, let me stay for one night in the fire-room."<br>
<br>"It is not inconvenient to me, great recluse, (but) there is a fierce serpent king of psychic power there; he is a terribly venomous snake. Do not let him harm you."<br>
<br>"It is not likely that he can harm me. Please do you, Kassapa, allow (me the use of) the fire-room,"<br>
<br>"Stay, great recluse, as you wish it."<br>
<br>
Then the Lord, having entered the fire-room, having laid down a grass mat, sat down cross-legged, keeping his back erect, having caused mindfulness to be present in front of him.</p>

<p><span class="parno">159</span>Then that serpent saw that the Lord had entered, and seeing this, pained, afflicted, he blew forth smoke. Then it occurred to the Lord: "What now if I, without destroying this serpent’s
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.25"></a>
 skin and hide and flesh and ligaments and bones and the marrow of the bones, were to master (his) heat by heat?"<br>
<br>
Then the Lord, having worked a work of psychic power, blew forth smoke. Then that serpent, not conquering anger, blazed up. The Lord, having attained the condition of heat, also blazed up. When both were in flames, the fire-room became as though burning, ablaze, in flames. Then the matted hair ascetics, having surrounded the fire-room, spoke thus:
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.34"></a>
 "Beautiful indeed is the great recluse, (but) he will be harmed by the serpent."<br>
<br>
Then the Lord at the end of that night, without having destroyed that serpent’s skin and hide and flesh and ligaments and bones and the marrow of the bones, having mastered (his) heat by heat, having placed him in his bowl, showed him to the matted hair ascetic, Uruvelākassapa, saying: "This, Kassapa, is your serpent, his heat was mastered by heat." Then it occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelākassapa: "Truly the great recluse is of great psychic power, of great majesty, in that he can master by heat the heat of the fierce serpent king who has psychic power and is a terribly venomous snake; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am."</p>

Near the Nerañjarā, the Lord <br>
spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelākassapa: <br>
"If it is not inconvenient to you, Kassapa, <br>
let me stay this day (only) in the fire-hall."</p>

<p><span class="parno">161</span>
"It is not inconvenient to me, great recluse, <br>

<p><span class="parno">162</span>
"It is not likely that he can harm me. <br>
Please do you, Kassapa, allow (me the use of) the fire-room."<br>
"It is given"; having understood this, <br>
the fearless one entered, fear overpassed.</p>

<p><span class="parno">163</span>
Having seen that the holy man had entered,
<br>
the chief of snakes, afflicted, blew forth smoke. <br>
The chief of men, joyful, unperturbed, <br>
blew forth smoke there
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.35"></a>
 too.</p>

<p><span class="parno">164</span>
But the chief of snakes, not conquering anger, <br>
blazed up like a fire. <br>
The chief of men, highly proficient in the condition of heat, <br>
blazed up there too.</p>

<p><span class="parno">165</span>
When both were in flames, <br>
the matted hair ascetics, as they were looking at the fire-room, said: <br>
"Beautiful indeed is the great recluse, <br>
(but) he will be harmed by the serpent."</p>

<p><span class="parno">166</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.15.7" href="#Kd.1.15.7"></a>
Then at the end of that night <br>
the serpent’s flames became extinguished, <br>
but the multicoloured flames of him of psychic power remained,</p>

<p><span class="parno">167</span>and multicoloured flames, dark green, <br>
then red, crimson, yellow and crystal-coloured <br>
were on Angirasa’s body.</p>

<p><span class="parno">168</span>
Having put the chief of snakes into his bowl, <br>
he showed him to the brahmin, saying: <br>

<p><span class="parno">169</span>Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa, thoroughly believing in this wonder of psychic power of the Lord, spoke thus to the Lord: "Stay just here, great recluse, I (can offer you) a constant supply of food."</p>

Then the Lord stayed in a certain woodland grove near the hermitage of the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa.

Now at that time a great sacrifice (made by) the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa was going forward, and the entire (population of) Anga and Magadha, taking abundant solid food and soft food, wanted to go (to it)).

Now at that time a rag-robe accrued to the Lord. Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now where can I wash the rag-robe?"

Then this occurred to me, Kassapa, ‘Now holding on to what can I come up out of (the water)?’ Then, Kassapa, a <i lang="pi">devatā</i> … said: ‘Lord, the Lord may come up from (the water) holding on here.’ So this <i lang="pi">kakudha</i> (tree) was a hold for my hand.

The matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa saw the Lord sitting in the fire-room; seeing him he spoke thus to the Lord: "By what way have you come, great recluse? I set out before you, but you are sitting in the fire-room, having arrived first."<br>

"Now I, Kassapa, having dismissed you, having gone to the Thirty, having plucked a flower from the Coral Tree, am sitting in the fire-room, having arrived first. Truly, Kassapa, this flower of the Coral Tree is full of colour, full of scent; if you like, do take it."<br>

 (owing to) the psychic might of the great recluse that we are unable to chop sticks." Then the Lord spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa: "Kassapa, let sticks be chopped."<br>
<br>"Let them be chopped, great recluse." Five hundred sticks were chopped simultaneously. Then it occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa: "Truly the great recluse is of great psychic power, of great might, in that also sticks are chopped; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am."<br>

Now at that time on the cold winter nights between the eights in a time of snowfall these matted hair ascetics were plunging into the river Nerañjarā, then emerging and repeatedly
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.42"></a>
 plunging in and out. Then the Lord created as many as five hundred fire-vessels just where these matted hair ascetics, having come up from (the river), warmed themselves.
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.32"></a>
 Then it occurred to these matted hair ascetics: "Doubtless it is (owing to) the psychic might of the great recluse that these fire-vessels are created."

Now at that time a great rain fell out of the proper season, and a great flood resulted. The Lord was staying in a place which became inundated by water. Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now suppose that I, having made the water recede all round, should pace up and down in the middle on dust-covered ground?" Then the Lord, having made the water recede all round, paced up and down in the middle on dust-covered ground. Then the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa, thinking: "I hope that the great recluse has not been carried away by the water," went together with a boat and many matted hair ascetics to that place where the Lord was staying. The matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa saw the Lord who, having made the water recede all round, was pacing up and down in the middle on dust-covered ground, and seeing him he spoke thus to the Lord: "Is it indeed you who are here, great recluse?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">191</span>"It is I, Kassapa," and the Lord having risen up above the ground, placed himself in the boat. Then it occurred to the matted hair ascetic Uruvelakassapa: "Truly the great recluse is of great psychic power, of great might, in that also the water does not carry him away; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am."<br>
<br>
Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now, for a long time it will occur to this foolish man, ‘Truly the great recluse is of
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.43"></a>
 great psychic power, of great might; but yet he is not a perfected one as I am.’ Now, suppose I should deeply stir this matted hair ascetic?" Then the Lord spoke thus to the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā: "Neither are you, Kassapa, a perfected one nor have you entered on the way to perfection, and that course is not for you by which you either could be a perfected one or could have entered on the way to perfection." Then the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā, having inclined his head to the Lord’s feet, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, may I receive the going forth in the Lord’s presence, may I receive ordination?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">192</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.20.18" href="#Kd.1.20.18"></a>
"It is you, Kassapa, who are leader, guide, highest, chief, head of five hundred matted hair ascetics; do consult these so that they can do what they think (right)." Then the matted hair ascetic Kassapa of Uruvelā approached these matted hair ascetics; having approached, he spoke thus to these matted hair ascetics: "I want,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.33"></a>
 good sirs, to fare the Brahma-faring under the great recluse; let the revered sirs do what they think (right)."<br>

<p><span class="parno">198</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.21.2" href="#Kd.1.21.2"></a>
And there the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Monks, everything is burning. And what, monks, is everything that is burning? The eye, monks, is burning, material shapes are burning, consciousness through the eye is burning, impingement on the eye is burning, in other words the feeling which arises from impingement on the eye, be it pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, that too is burning. With what is it burning? I say it is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of stupidity; it is burning because of birth, ageing, dying, because of grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair.<br>
<br>
"The ear is burning, sounds are burning … the nose is burning, odours are burning … the tongue is burning, tastes are burning … the body is burning, tangible objects are burning … the mind is burning, mental states are burning, consciousness through the mind is burning, impingement on the mind is burning, in other words the feeling which raises through impingement on the mind, be it pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, that too is burning.

 disregards consciousness through the eye and he disregards impingement on the eye, in other words the feeling which arises from impingement on the eye, be it pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant, that too he disregards.

Then the Lord, walking on tour, in due course arrived at Rājagaha. The Lord stayed there at Rājagaha in the Palm Grove pleasure ground in the Supatiṭṭha shrine.<br>
<br>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard: "Verily, the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, has reached Rājagaha and is
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.47"></a>
 staying at Rājagaha in the Palm Grove pleasure ground in the Supatiṭṭha shrine. A lovely reputation has gone forth concerning the Lord Gotama, thus: He is indeed Lord, perfected one, fully awakened one, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well-farer, knower of the worlds, unrivalled charioteer of men to be tamed, teacher of <i lang="pi">devas</i> and mankind, awakened one, Lord. Having realised them by his own super-knowledge, he makes known this world with its <i lang="pi">devas</i>, with its Māras, with its Brahmās, creatures with <i lang="pi">devas</i> and men, with recluses and brahmans. He teaches <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, lovely at the beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely at the ending. He explains with the spirit and the letter the Brahma-faring completely fulfilled and wholly pure. Good indeed it were to see perfected ones like this."</p>

<p><span class="parno">203</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.22.3" href="#Kd.1.22.3"></a>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, surrounded by twelve myriad brahmans and householders of Magadha, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. Then some of these twelve myriad
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.36"></a>
 brahmans and householders of Magadha having greeted the Lord, sat down at a respectful distance; some exchanged greetings with the Lord, and having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy, they sat down at a respectful distance; some having saluted the Lord with joined palms, sat down at a respectful distance; some having shouted out their name and clan before the Lord, sat down at a respectful distance; some having become silent, sat down at a respectful distance.<br>
<br>
Then it occurred to those twelve myriad brahmans and householders of Magadha: "Now, does the great recluse fare the Brahma-faring under Kassapa of Uruvelā, or does Kassapa of Uruvelā fare the Brahma-faring under the great recluse?" Then the Lord, knowing with his mind the reasoning in the minds of those twelve myriad brahmans and householders of Magadha, addressed Kassapa of Uruvelā with the verses:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">204</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.48"></a>
"What hast thou seen, O dweller in Uruvelā,<br>
That thou, known as emaciate, hast abandoned the (sacred) fire?<br>
I ask thee about this matter, Kassapa:<br>
Hast thou abandoned thy fire-implements?"
</p>

<p><span class="parno">205</span>
‘‘The sacrifices speak of forms and sounds, <br>
Also of tastes, pleasures and women. <br>
Knowing that ‘This is dross’ among affections—<br>
Therefore I delighted not in sacrifice, in offering."</p>

<p><span class="parno">206</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.22.5" href="#Kd.1.22.5"></a>
"But if your mind delights not there, Kassapa," the Lord said,<br>
"Among forms, sounds and also tastes,<br>
Then in the world of <i lang="pi">devas</i> and men what does your mind delight in?<br>
Kassapa, tell me that."
</p>

<p><span class="parno">207</span>
"When I had seen the path, peaceful, without substrate,<br>
Stainless, not attached to sensations’ becoming,<br>
Not becoming otherwise, where one cannot be led by others—<br>
In consequence, I delighted not in sacrifice, in offering."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">208</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.22.6" href="#Kd.1.22.6"></a>
Then the venerable Kassapa of Uruvelā, rising from his seat, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having inclined his head towards the Lord’s feet, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, the Lord is my teacher, I am a disciple; Lord, the Lord is my teacher, I am a disciple.’’ Then it occurred to those twelve myriad Brahmāns and householders of Magadha: "Kassapa of Uruvelā fares the Brahma-faring under the great recluse."<br>
<br>
Then the Lord, knowing by mind the reasoning in the minds of these twelve myriad Brahmāns and householders of Magadha,
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.49"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.37"></a>
 talked a progressive talk … stopping, the Way.<br>
<br>
And as a clean cloth without black specks will easily take a dye, even so as the twelve myriad Brahmans and householders of Magadha with Bimbisāra at their head were (sitting) in those very seats, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to them, that "Whatever is of the nature to uprise, all that is of the nature to stop," and one myriad declared themselves to be lay-followers.</p>

<p><span class="parno">209</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.22.9" href="#Kd.1.22.9"></a>
Then King Bimbisāra of Magadha, having seen <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, attained <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, known <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, plunged into <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, having crossed over doubt, put away uncertainty, having attained without another’s help to full confidence in the teacher’s instruction, spoke thus to the Lord: "Formerly, Lord, when I was a young man I had five ambitions. These are now realised by me. Formerly, Lord, when I was a young man it occurred to me: ‘Might I be anointed into kingship.’ This was my first ambition, Lord. It has now been realised by me. And ‘Might the perfected one, the fully awakened one come into my realm.’ This, Lord, was my second ambition. It has now been realised by me.<br>
<br>
"‘That I might pay homage to this Lord.’ This, Lord, was my third ambition. It has now been realised by me. And ‘May that Lord teach me <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.’ This, Lord, was my fourth ambition. It has now been realised by me. And ‘Might I understand that Lord’s <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>.’ This, Lord, was my fifth ambition. It has now been realised by me. Formerly, Lord, when I was a young man I had these five ambitions. They are now realised by me.<br>
<br>
"Excellent, Lord! Excellent, Lord! Even, Lord, as one might set upright what has been upset … even so is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> explained in many a figure by the Lord. So I, Lord, go to the Lord as refuge and to <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and to the Order of monks. Lord, may the Lord accept me as a lay-disciple gone for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts. And, Lord, may the Lord consent
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.38"></a>
 to a meal with me to-morrow together with the Order of monks." The Lord consented by becoming silent.<br>
<br>
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.50"></a>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having understood the Lord’s consent, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having had sumptuous food, solid and soft, prepared, at the end of that night had the time announced to the Lord, saying: "Lord, it is time, the meal is ready."</p>

<p><span class="parno">210</span>Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha together with the large Order of monks, with all those same thousand monks who had formerly been matted-hair ascetics.<br>
<br>Now at that time Sakka, lord of the <i lang="pi">devas</i>, having assumed the form of a Brahman youth, walked in front of the Order of monks with the Lord at its head, singing these verses:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">211</span>
"The tamed with the tamed, <br>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">216</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.22.14" href="#Kd.1.22.14"></a>
People having seen Sakka, lord of the <i lang="pi">devas</i>, spoke thus: "Indeed this brahman youth is lovely, indeed this brahman youth is good to look upon, indeed this brahman youth is
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.51"></a>
 charming. Whose, now, is this brahman youth?" When they had spoken thus, Sakka, lord of the <i lang="pi">devas</i>, addressed these people with a verse:</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">217</span>
"He who is steadfast, tamed in every way, <br>
awakened, peerless among men,<br>
Perfected, well-farer, <br>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">218</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.22.15" href="#Kd.1.22.15"></a>
Then the Lord approached the dwelling of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha; having approached he sat down on the appointed seat together with the Order of monks. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, with his own hand having offered, having satisfied the Order of monks with the awakened one at its head with sumptuous food, solid and soft, when the Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, sat down at a respectful distance.
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.39"></a>
<br>
<br>
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance it occurred to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha: "Now, where could the Lord stay that would be neither too far from a village nor too near, suitable for coming and going, accessible for people whenever they want, not crowded by day, having little noise at night, little sound, without folk’s breath, haunts of privacy, suitable for seclusion?"<br>
<br>
Then it occurred to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha: "Now, this Bamboo Grove of ours, a pleasure park, is neither too far from a village … suitable for seclusion. Suppose I were to give the Bamboo Grove, a pleasure park, to the Order of the monks with the awakened one at its head?"<br>
<br>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having taken a ceremonial vessel made of gold, dedicated it to the Lord, saying: "May I, Lord, give this Bamboo Grove, a pleasure park, to the Order of monks with the awakened one at its head?" The Lord accepted the park. Then the Lord, having gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, having risen
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.52"></a>
 from his seat, departed. Then the Lord, on this occasion having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: "Monks, I allow a park."</p>

At that time the wanderer Sañjaya was residing in Rājagaha together with a great company of wanderers, with two hundred and fifty wanderers. Now at that time Sāriputta and Moggallāna fared the Brahma-faring under the wanderer Sañjaya, and an agreement came to be formed by these: "Whoever attains the deathless first, let him announce it."</p>

<p><span class="parno">221</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.23.2" href="#Kd.1.23.2"></a>
Then the venerable Assaji,having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for almsfood. He was pleasing whether he was approaching or departing, whether he was looking in front or looking behind, whether he was drawing in or stretching out (his arm), his eyes were cast down, he was possessed of pleasant behaviour. The wanderer Sāriputta saw the venerable Assaji walking for almsfood in Rājagaha—pleasing whether he was approaching … possessed of pleasant behaviour—and seeing him, it occurred to him: "This is one of those monks who are indeed perfected ones in the world or who have entered on the way to perfection. What
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.40"></a>
 now if I, having approached this monk, should ask him: ‘On account of whom are you, your reverence, gone forth, or who is your teacher, or whose <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> do you profess’?"<br>
<br>
Then it occurred to the wanderer Sāriputta: "But it is not the right time to question this monk, he has gone in among the houses, he is walking for almsfood. What now if I should follow close after this monk who has learnt a way for those who need it?" Then the venerable Assaji, having walked
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.53"></a>
 for almsfood in Rājagaha, taking his almsbowl, returned. Then the wanderer Sāriputta approached the venerable Assaji; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the venerable Assaji; having exchanged courteous and friendly greetings, he stood at a respectful distance. As he was standing at a respectful distance, the wanderer Sāriputta spoke thus to the venerable Assaji: "Your reverence, your faculties are quite pure, your complexion very bright, very clear. On account of whom, your reverence, have you gone forth, or who is your teacher, or whose <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> do you profess?"<br>
<br>
"There is, friend, a great recluse, a son of the Sakyans, gone forth from a Sakyan family. I have gone forth on account of this Lord and this Lord is my teacher and I profess this Lord’s <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>."<br>
<br>"But what is the doctrine of your reverence’s teacher, what does he point out?"<br>
<br>
"Now, I, friend, am new, not long gone forth, fresh to this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline. I am not able to teach you <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> in full, but I can tell you its purport briefly."<br>
<br>Then the wanderer Sāriputta spoke thus to the venerable Assaji: "So be it, your reverence,</p>

<p><span class="parno">222</span>tell me little or tell me much, (but) in any case explain to me its purport; I want just its purport. Why should you make a great elaboration?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">223</span>Then the venerable Assaji uttered this terse expression of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to the wanderer Sāriputta:</p>

<p><span class="parno">225</span>
When the wanderer Sāriputta had heard this terse expression of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, there arose <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, that "Whatever is of the nature to uprise all that is of the nature to stop." He said:</p>

Now at that time those who shared cells did not conduct themselves properly towards their preceptors. Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can those who share cells not conduct themselves properly towards their preceptors?" Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said: "Is it true, as is said, monks, that those who share cells do not conduct themselves properly towards their preceptors?"<br>
<br>"It is true, Lord."<br>
<br>The enlightened one, the Lord rebuked them, saying:<br>
<br>"How, monks, can those who share cells not conduct themselves properly towards their preceptors?" <br>
<br>
Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, the Lord addressed the monks, saying: <span class="rule">"<span class="rule">Monks, <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.54"></a>
 those who share cells should not not conduct themselves properly towards their preceptors. Whoever should not conduct himself properly, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>"</span><br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.27.2" href="#Kd.1.27.2"></a>
Even so, they did not conduct themselves properly.</p>

<p><span class="parno">287</span>They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "I allow you, monks, to dismiss one who does not conduct himself properly. And thus, monks, should he be dismissed: If he, saying: ‘I dismiss you’ or ‘Do not come back here’ or ‘Bring back your bowl and robe’ or ‘I am not to be waited upon by you’, makes this understood by gesture, if he makes this understood by voice, if he makes this understood by gesture and by voice, the one who shares the cell comes to be dismissed. If he does not make this understood by gesture, if he does not make this understood by voice, if he does not make this understood by gesture and by voice, the one who shares the cell does not come to be dismissed.<br>

<p><span class="parno">288</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.27.3" href="#Kd.1.27.3"></a>
Now at that time those who shared a cell and who were dismissed did not apologise. They told this matter to the

 Lord. He said: "I allow (them), monks, to apologise." Even so, they did not apologise. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:
<span class="rule">"Monks, one who is dismissed is not not to apologise. Whoever should not apologise, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>"<br>
<br>

<p><span class="parno">289</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.27.4" href="#Kd.1.27.4"></a>
Now at that time preceptors, on being apologised to, did not forgive. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to forgive.</span>" Even so, they did not forgive. And those who shared a cell departed and they left the Order and they went over to (other) sects. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:
<span class="rule">"Monks, when you are being apologised to you should not not forgive. Whoever should not forgive, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>"<br>

Now at that time preceptors dismissed those who were conducting themselves properly, they did not dismiss those who were not conducting themselves properly. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:
<span class="rule">"Monks, one who is conducting himself properly is not to be dismissed. Whoever should dismiss him, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="rule">And, monks, one who is not conducting himself properly is not not to be dismissed. Whoever should not dismiss him, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>

Now at that time a certain brahman, having approached (some) monks, asked for the going forth. The monks did not want to let him go forth, and because he could not obtain the going forth among the monks, he became lean, wretched, of a bad colour, very yellow, his veins standing out all over his body. The Lord saw this brahman, lean … all over his body, and seeing him, he addressed the monks, saying: "How is it, monks, that this brahman is lean … all over his body?"<br>
<br>"Lord, this brahman asked the monks for the going forth. The monks did not want to let him go forth, and because he could not obtain the going forth among the monks, he is lean … all over his body."<br>
<br>
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.72"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Now, monks, who remembers a service done by this brahman?" When he had spoken thus the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord: "I, Lord, remember a service done by this brahman."<br>
<br>"Now, what help (given) by this brahman, Sāriputta, do you remember?"<br>
<br>
"Lord, as I was walking for almsfood here in Rājagaha this brahman had spoon-alms bestowed upon me. This, Lord, is the service done by this brahman <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.56"></a>
which I remember."<br>
<br>
"Good, Sāriputta, it is good. Indeed those who are truly men, Sāriputta, are thankful and grateful. Because of this do you, Sāriputta, let this brahman go forth (and) ordain him."<br>
<br>"How, lord, do I let this brahman go forth, how do I ordain him?"</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">298</span>Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>

<br>"From this day forth, monks, I abolish that ordination by going to the three refuges which I allowed. I allow you, monks, to ordain by a (formal) act consisting of a motion and a resolution put three times.<br>

<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.29.1" href="#Kd.1.29.1"></a>
Now at that time a certain monk immediately after he was ordained indulged in bad habits. Monks spoke thus: "Do not, your reverence, do that, it is not allowed." He spoke thus: "But indeed, I did not ask the venerable ones saying, ‘Ordain me’. Why did you ordain me without being asked (to do so)?" They told this matter to the Lord.
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.57"></a>
 He said:

Now at that time in Rājagaha a succession of meals of sumptuous foods came to be arranged. Then it occurred to a certain brahman: "Now, these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, are pleasant in character, pleasant in conduct; having eaten good meals they lie down on beds sheltered from the wind. What now if I should go forth among these recluses, sons of the Sakyans?" Then that brahman, having approached (some) monks, asked for the going forth. The monks allowed him to go forth (and) they ordained him.<br>
<br>
The succession of meals dwindled away after he had gone forth. Monks spoke thus: "Come along now, your reverence, we will walk for almsfood." He spoke thus: "Your reverences, I did not go forth for this—that I should walk for almsfood. If you will give to me, I will eat, but if you will not give to me, I will leave the Order."<br>
<br>
"But, did you, your reverence, go forth for your belly’s sake?" <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.58"></a>
<br>
<br>"Yes, your reverences."<br>
<br>
Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can this monk go forth in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline which are well taught for his belly’s sake?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">311</span>These monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>

 nor for increasing (the number of) those who are pleased." Having rebuked him, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:<br>
<br>
"I allow you, monks, when you are ordaining, to explain four resources: that going forth is on account of meals of scraps; in this respect effort is to be made by you for life. (These are) extra acquisitions: a meal for an Order, a meal for a special person, an invitation, ticket-food, (food given) on a day of the waxing or waning of the moon, on an Observance day, or the day after an Observance day. That going forth is on account of rag-robes; in this respect effort is to be made by you for life. (These are) extra acquisitions: (robes made of) linen, cotton, silk, wool, coarse hemp, canvas. That going forth is on account of a lodging at the root of a tree; in this respect effort is to be made by you for life. (These are) extra acquisitions: a dwelling-place, a curved house, a long house, a mansion, a cave. That going forth is on account of ammonia as a medicine; in this respect effort is to be made by you for life. (These are) extra acquisitions: ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey, molasses."</p>

<p><span class="parno">313</span>
Now at that time a certain brahman youth, having approached <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.76"></a>
(some) monks, asked for the going forth. The monks explained the resources to him beforehand. He spoke thus: "If honoured sirs, you had explained the resources to me after I had gone forth, I should have been satisfied, but now, honoured sirs, I will not go forth; the resources are disgusting and loathsome to me." The monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>

Now at that time monks ordained through a group of two and a group of three (monks). They told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>

"<span class="rule">Monks, you should not ordain through a group of less than ten (monks). Whoever should (so) ordain, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span> I allow you, monks, to ordain through a group of ten or more than ten (monks)."</p>

Now at that time monks of one year’s standing and of two years’ standing (severally) ordained the one who shared his cell. And when he was of one year’s standing, the venerable Upasena, Vanganta’s son, ordained the one who shared his cell. When he was of two years’ standing, having kept the rains-residence, taking the one who shared his cell and who was of one year’s standing, he approached the Lord. Having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. Now, it is the custom for awakened ones, for Lords to exchange friendly greetings with in-coming monks.<br>
<br>
Then the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Upasena, Vanganta’s son: "I hope, monk, that things go well with you, I hope you are keeping going, I hope you came here with but little fatigue on the journey."<br>
<br>
"Things do go well with me, Lord, I am keeping going, <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.77"></a>
Lord, I came, Lord, with but little fatigue on the journey."<br>
<br>
Now, Truthfinders (sometimes) ask knowing, and knowing (sometimes) do not ask; they ask, knowing the right time (to ask), and they do not ask, knowing the right time (when not to ask). Truthfinders ask about what belongs to the goal, not about what does not belong to the goal. There is bridge-breaking, for Truthfinders in whatever does not belong to the goal. Awakened ones, Lords, question monks concerning two matters: "Shall we teach <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>?" or "Shall we lay down a rule of training for disciples?"<br>
<br>
Then the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Upasena, Vanganta’s son: "Of how many years’ standing are you, monk?"<br>
<br>"I, Lord, am of two years’ standing."<br>
<br>"And of how many years’ standing is this monk?"<br>
<br>"He is of one year’s standing, Lord."<br>
<br>"Who is this monk as regards you?"<br>
<br>"He is the one who shares my cell, Lord."<br>
<br>The awakened one, the Lord rebuked (him), saying:<br>
<br>"It is not fitting, foolish man, it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is unworthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it should not be done. How can you, foolish man, when you should be exhorted and instructed by others, think to exhort and instruct another (monk)? Too quickly have you, foolish man, turned to abundance, that is to say to acquiring a group. It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, nor for increasing (the number of) those who are pleased." Having rebuked him, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:<br>

<span class="rule">Monks, one who is of less than ten years’ standing should not ordain. Whoever (such) should (so) ordain, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>

Now at that time ignorant, inexperienced monks ordained thinking: "We are of ten years’ standing, we are of ten years’ standing." (Consequently) there were to be found ignorant preceptors, wise (monks) who shared their cells; inexperienced preceptors, experienced (monks) who shared their cells; preceptors who had heard little, (monks) who shared their cells who had heard much; preceptors of poor intelligence,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.60"></a>

<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.79"></a>
 teachers, not being exhorted, not being instructed, walked for almsfood wrongly dressed, wrongly clothed, not befittingly attired. While people were eating, they held their almsbowls close above the soft food for the remains, and they held their almsbowls close above the solid food for the remains, and they held their almsbowls close above the savoury food for the remains, and they held their almsbowls close above the beverages for the remains, and having themselves asked for curry and boiled rice, they ate it, and they remained in the refectory making a loud noise, a great noise. <br>

People … spread it about, saying: "How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, walk for almsfood, wrongly dressed, wrongly clothed, not befittingly attired?

<br>Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. <br>
<br>Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned the monks, saying: "Is it true, as is said, monks, that monks walk for almsfood wrongly dressed … and remain in the refectory making a great noise, a loud noise?"<br>
<br>"It is true, Lord."<br>
<br>Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">319</span>"Monks, I allow a teacher. The teacher, monks, should arouse in his pupil the attitude of a son; the pupil should arouse in his teacher the attitude of a father. Thus these, living with reverence, with deference, with courtesy towards one another, will come to growth, increase, maturity in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline.

 I will live in dependence on the venerable one.’</span> If he says: ‘Very well’ or ‘Certainly’ or ‘All right’ or ‘It is proper’ or ‘Manage it amiably’, and makes this understood by gesture. If he says: ‘Very well’ or ‘Certainly’ or ‘All right’ or ‘It is proper’ or ‘Manage it amiably’, and makes this understood by gesture, makes this understood by speech, makes this understood by gesture and by speech, the teacher has been chosen; if he does not make this understood by gesture, if he does not make this understood by speech, if he does not make this understood by gesture and by speech, the teacher has not been chosen.</p>

<p><span class="parno">321</span>Having got up early, having taken off his sandals, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, he should give tooth-wood, he should give water for rinsing the mouth, he should make ready a seat. If there is conjey, having washed a bowl, the conjey should be placed near (the preceptor). When he has drunk the conjey, having given him water, having received the bowl, having lowered it, having washed it properly without rubbing it, it should be put away. When the preceptor has got up, the seat should be removed. If that place is soiled, that place should be swept.</p>

<p><span class="parno">322</span>
"If the preceptor wishes to enter a village, his inner clothing should be given (to him), the inner clothing (that he is wearing) should be received (from him) in return, the girdle should be given (to him); having folded them (into two or four folds), the outer robes are to be given (to him); having washed it, a bowl with water is to be given (to him). If the preceptor desires an attendant, (the latter) having put on his inner robe all round so as to cover the three circles, having bound on the girdle, having folded them and having dressed in the outer robes, having fastened the ties, having washed, having taken a bowl, should be the preceptor’s attendant. He should not walk too far away (from him), he should not walk too close. He should receive the bowl and its contents.<br>
<br>
"He should not interrupt the preceptor when he is speaking. (But) if the preceptor is bordering on an offence, then speaking himself, he should warn him.</p>

<p><span class="parno">422</span>Now at that time five diseases were prevalent among the people of Magadha: leprosy, boils, eczema, consumption, epilepsy. People, afflicted with the five diseases, having approached Jīvaka Komārabhacca, spoke thus: "It were good, teacher, if you would attend us."<br>
<br>
"But I, masters, am very busy, there is much to be done, and King <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.72"></a>
Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha is to be looked after by me, also the women’s quarters and the Order of monks with the awakened one at its head. I am not able to attend you."<br>
<br>"All this property shall become yours, teacher, and we will be your slaves. It were good, teacher, if you would attend us."<br>
<br>"But I, masters, am very busy … I am not able to attend you."<br>

 from the wind. Suppose we were to go forth among the recluses, sons of the Sakyans? In that case monks would look after us and moreover Jīvaka Komārabhacca would attend us." Then these people, having approached (some) monks, asked for the going forth. The monks let them go forth, they ordained them. These monks looked after them and moreover Jīvaka Komārabhacca attended them.<br>

Now at that time monks, looking after many ill monks, lived intent on asking, intent on hinting, saying: "Give food for the sick, give food for those who look after the sick, give medicines for the sick."

<br>"Yes, teacher."<br>

The generals, the chief ministers … spread it about, saying: "How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, let one who is in the king’s service go forth?" The generals, the chief ministers told this matter to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha asked the chief ministers of justice:<br>
<br>"Good sirs, what does he who lets one go forth who is in a king’s service engender (for himself)?"<br>

Come along, let us bring him (back)." Some spoke thus: "Do not, masters, speak thus, for it is decreed by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha: ‘There is nothing to do against those who go forth among the recluses, sons of the Sakyans. Well preached is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, let them fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill’." People … spread it about, saying:<br>
<br>"These recluses, sons of the Sakyans are safe and secure; there is nothing to do against them. But how can they let a debtor go forth?" They told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>
<br>

Now at that time a certain bald-headed metal-smith, having quarrelled with his parents, having gone to a monastery, went forth among the monks. Then the parents of that bald-headed metal-smith, searching for that bald-headed metal-smith, having gone to the monastery, asked the monks, saying: "Honoured sirs, have you seen a youth like that?" The monks, not knowing (him), merely said: "We do not know (him)"; not seeing (him), merely said: "We do not see (him)."<br>
<br>
Then the parents of that bald-headed metal-smith, searching for that bald-headed metal-smith

Monks heard the parents of this bald-headed metal-smith who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>

Now at that time in Rājagaha a group of seventeen boys were friends; of these the youth Upāli was the chief. Then it occurred to Upāli’s parents: "By what means could Upāli, after our demise, live at ease and not be in want?" Then it occurred to Upāli’s parents: "If Upāli should learn writing, so would Upāli, after our demise, live at ease and not be in want." Then it occurred to Upāli’s parents: "But if Upāli
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.97"></a>
 learns writing his fingers will become painful. If Upāli were to learn calculation, so would Upāli, after our demise, live at ease and not be in want." <br>
<br>
Then it occurred to Upāli’s parents: "But if Upāli learns calculation, his breast will become painful. If Upāli were to learn money-changing, so would Upāli, after our demise, live at ease and not be in want." Then it occurred to Upāli’s parents: "But if Upāli learns money-changing his eyes will become painful. Now there are these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, pleasant in habit, pleasant in conduct; having eaten good meals, they lie down on beds sheltered from the wind. Now if Upāli were to go forth among the recluses, sons of the Sakyans, so would Upāli, after our demise, live at ease and not be in want."</p>

<p><span class="parno">438</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.49.3" href="#Kd.1.49.3"></a>
The boy Upāli heard this conversation of his parents. Then the boy Upāli approached those boys; having approached, he spoke thus to these boys: "Come, masters, we will go forth among the recluses, sons of the Sakyans."<br>
<br>"If you, master, will go forth, we likewise will also go forth." Then these boys, having (each) approached his parents, spoke thus:<br>
<br>
"Consent that I may go forth from home into homelessness." Then <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.78"></a>
the parents of those boys consented, thinking: "All these boys want the same thing, they are bent on what is good." These, having approached monks, asked for the going forth. These monks let them go forth, they ordained them.<br>
<br>
Getting up in the night towards dawn, these cried out: "Give conjey, give rice, give solid food."<br>
<br>The monks spoke thus: "Wait, your reverences, until it turns light. Should there be conjey you shall drink it; should there be rice you shall partake of it; should there be solid food you shall eat it. But should there not be conjey or rice or solid food, then, having walked for alms, you shall eat."<br>
<br>But these monks, being spoken to thus by the monks, cried out just the same: "Give conjey, give rice, give solid food," and they soiled and wetted the bedding.</p>

<p><span class="parno">439</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.1.49.5" href="#Kd.1.49.5"></a>
Then the Lord, getting up in the night towards dawn, hearing this noise of boys, addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying: "Why ever, Ānanda, is there this noise of boys?" Then the
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.98"></a>
 venerable Ānanda told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>
<br>"Is it true as is said, monks, that monks knowingly ordain an individual who is under twenty years of age?"<br>
<br>"It is true, Lord." The awakened one, the Lord rebuked them, saying:<br>
<br>"How, monks, can these foolish men knowingly ordain an individual who is under twenty years of age?<br>
<br>
Monks, an individual under twenty years of age is not able to endure cold, heat, hunger, thirst, the sting of gadflies or mosquitoes, wind and sun, creeping things, abusive, hurtful language; he is not the kind (of person) who endures bodily feelings which, arising, are painful, acute, sharp, shooting, disagreeable, miserable, deadly. But, monks, an individual of twenty years of age is able to endure cold, heat … miserable, deadly. Monks, this is not for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased, nor for increasing the number of those who are pleased." Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:<br>
<br>
"<span class="rule">Monks, an individual who is under twenty years of age should not knowingly be ordained. Whoever should (so) ordain (one such) should be dealt with according to the rule.</span>"</p>

Now at that time a certain family came to pass away as a result of malaria. (Only) the father and little son belonging to it survived. These, having gone forth among the monks, walked even for almsfood together. Then that boy, when almsfood was given to his father, having run up to him, spoke thus: "Give to me too, father, give to me too, father." People
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.79"></a>
 … spread it about, saying: "These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, are not chaste. This boy was born of
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.99"></a>
 a nun." Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>

These, having seen monks, ran up to them according to their former allowable custom, (but) the monks sent them away. These cried on being sent away by the monks. Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda: "It is laid down by the Lord that a boy of less than fifteen years of age should not be allowed to go forth, and these boys are less than fifteen years of age. Now by what means might these boys not be lost?" Then the venerable Ānanda told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>
<br>"But, Ānanda, are these boys able to scare crows?" <br>
<br>"They are able (to do so), Lord." Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>

 upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can these novices indulge in a bad habit such as this?" They told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>

People … spread it about, saying: "The district is crowded up, confused with recluses, sons of the Sakyans; because of them the district is not to be seen." Monks, heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord.<br>
<br>
Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying: "Go, Ānanda, and taking a key,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.80"></a>
 announce to the monks in every cell: "Your reverences, the Lord wishes to set out on tour for Dakkhiṇāgiri. Whatever venerable one needs (to do so), let him come."<br>
<br>"Yes, Lord," and the venerable Ānanda, having answered the Lord in assent, taking the key, announced to the monks in every cell: "Your reverences, the Lord wishes to set out on tour for Dakkhiṇāgiri. Whatever venerable one needs (to do so), let him come."<br>
<br>
Monks spoke thus: "Reverend Ānanda, it is laid down by the Lord (that one is) to live ten years in dependence, and when one is of ten years’ standing (he is) to give guidance. If we go there then guidance must be chosen (there), but the

If our teachers and preceptors are going, we too will go; but if our teachers and preceptors are not going, then we will not go. Reverend Ānanda, we shall (otherwise) look feather-brained." Then the Lord set out on tour for Dakkhiṇāgiri with an Order of monks numbering less than a group.</p>

 Then the Lord, having stayed in Dakkhiṇāgiri for as long as he found suiting, came back again to Rājagaha.

The Lord stayed there in Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the family who supported the venerable Sāriputta sent a youth to the venerable Sāriputta, saying: "May the elder let this youth go forth." Then it occurred to the venerable Sāriputta: "A rule of training laid down by the Lord says that two novices should not attend one (monk), and this Rāhula is my novice. Now what line of conduct should be followed by me?" He told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>
