At that time Sanjaya, the wanderer was dwelling in Rajagaha with a large
assembly of wanderers, with two hundred and fifty wanderers. At that time
Sariputta and Moggallana were living the life of purity under Sanjaya, the
wanderer. They had made an agreement: “He who attains the deathless
first, he must inform the other of it.” Then in the morning, the
venerable Assaji, having dressed, having taken bowl and robe, entered
Rajagaha for alms food. With eyes down cast, he was endowed with deportment:
Graceful when stepping forwards, when stepping backwards, when looking
forwards, when looking backwards, when bending back, when stretching out.

<p><span class="parno">13</span>
Sariputta, the wanderer saw the venerable Assaji wandering in Rajagaha for
alms food with eyes down cast, endowed with deportment: Graceful when
stepping forwards, when stepping backwards, when looking forwards, when
looking backwards, when bending back, when stretching out. Having seen, it
occurred to him: “Surely, this bhikkhu is one of those who are arahants
in the world, or have entered upon the path to arahantship. What if, having
approached this bhikkhu, I might ask: On account of whom, O friend, have you
gone forth? Who is your Teacher? Whose dhamma do you prefer?”

<p><span class="parno">14</span>
It then occurred to Sariputta, the wanderer: “It is the wrong time to ask
this bhikkhu, he has entered among the houses, wandering for alms food. What
if I were to pursue this bhikkhu closely behind to find out the path [I am]
seeking for.” Then the venerable Assaji, having wandered in
Rajagaha for alms food, having taken alms food, returned. Then, by which way
[led to] the venerable Assaji, by that way Sariputta, the wanderer
approached. Having approached the venerable Assaji, they exchanged friendly
greetings. Having exchanged friendly greetings and cordial talk, he stood at
one side. Having stood at one side, Sariputta, the wanderer said this to the
venerable Assaji: “O friend, your faculties are very clear, your
complexion is pure and bright. On account of whom, O friend, have you gone
forth? Who is your teacher? Whose dhamma do you prefer?”

<p><span class="parno">15</span>
“There is, O friend, the Great Samana, son of the Sakyans, one gone forth
from the Sakyan clan. I have gone forth on account of that Auspicious
One. That Auspicious One is my Teacher, and I prefer the Dhamma of the
Auspicious One.” “But, what is the doctrine of the venerable's
Teacher?  What does he declare?” “I, O friend, am new, not long
gone forth, just arrived at this Dhammavinaya. That is, I am not able to
teach the dhamma with details. Nevertheless, I will say for you the meaning
in brief.” So then, Sariputta, the wanderer said this to the
venerable Assaji: Let that be, O friend.

<blockquote>
<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “You speak little or much,<br> say to me just [enough] to know the
meaning,<br> the meaning, just the meaning for me,<br> what will many words
do?”
</p>

Then the venerable Assaji spoke this dhamma discourse for Sariputta, the
wanderer:

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Those dhammas which arise from a cause,<br> of those the Tathagata has
told the cause,<br> and that which is their cessation,<br> thus is the doctrine
of the Great Samana.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>
Then Sariputta, the wanderer, having heard this dhamma discourse, the
stainless, spotless dhamma eye arose: “Whatever is liable to arising, all
that is liable to cessation.”

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Just this is the Dhamma, which when penetrated,<br> at that moment
[reveals] the sorrowless path,<br> gone by unseen,<br> by which many aeons have
come to be.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
Then by which way [led to] Moggallana, the wanderer, by that way Sariputta,
the wanderer approached. Moggallana, the wanderer saw Sariputta, the
wanderer approaching from afar. Having seen Sariputta, the wanderer, he said
this: “O friend, your faculties are very clear, your complexion is pure
and bright. Perhaps, O friend, you have attained the deathless for
us?” “We, O friend, have attained the deathless.”
“But how, O friend, how did you attain the deathless?” Here I, O
friend, saw the bhikkhu Assaji in Rajagaha wandering for alms food, with
eyes down cast, endowed with deportment: Graceful when stepping forwards,
when stepping backwards, when looking forwards, when looking backwards, when
bending back, when stretching out. Having seen, it occurred to me:
“Surely, this bhikkhu is one of those who are arahants in the world, or
have entered upon the path to arahantship. What if, having approached this
bhikkhu, I might ask: On account of whom, O friend, have you gone forth? Who
is your Teacher? Whose dhamma do you prefer?” It then occurred to
me: “It is the wrong time to ask this bhikkhu, he has entered among the
houses, wandering for alms food. What if I were to pursue this bhikkhu
closely behind to find out the path [I am] seeking for.”

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
Then the bhikkhu Assaji, having wandered in Rajagaha for alms food, having
taken alms food, returned. Then, by which way [led to] the bhikkhu Assaji,
by that way I approached. Having approached the bhikkhu Assaji, we exchanged
friendly greetings. Having exchanged friendly greetings and cordial talk, I
stood at one side. Having stood at one side, I said this to the bhikkhu
Assaji: “O friend, your faculties are very clear, your complexion is pure
and bright. On account of whom, O friend, have you gone forth? Who is your
teacher? Whose dhamma do you prefer?”

<p><span class="parno">19</span>
“There is, O friend, the Great Samana, son of the Sakyans, the one gone
forth from the Sakyan clan. I have gone forth on account of that Auspicious
One. That Auspicious One is my Teacher, and I prefer the Dhamma of the
Auspicious One.” “But what is the doctrine of the venerable's
Teacher? What does he declare?” “I, O friend, am new, one not
long gone forth, just arrived at this Dhammavinaya. That is, I am not able
to teach the dhamma with details. Nevertheless, I will say for you the
meaning in brief.”

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “You speak little or much,<br> say to me just [enough] to know the
meaning,<br> the meaning, just the meaning for me,<br> what will many words
do?”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>
Then, O friend, this is the dhamma discourse the bhikkhu Assaji spoke:

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Those dhammas which arise from a cause,<br> of those the Tathagata has
told the cause,<br> and that which is their cessation,<br> thus is the doctrine
of the Great Samana.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">21</span>
Then Moggallana, the wanderer, having heard this dhamma discourse, the
stainless, spotless dhamma eye arose: “Whatever is liable to arising, all
that is liable to cessation.”

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “Just this is the Dhamma, which when penetrated,<br> at that moment
[reveals] the sorrowless path,<br> gone by unseen,<br> by which many aeons have
come to be.”
</p>

<p><span class="parno">22</span>
So then, Moggallana, the wanderer said this to Sariputta, the wanderer:
“We must go, O friend, to the presence of the Auspicious One. He is our
Teacher, the Auspicious One.” “These two hundred and fifty
wanderers, O friend, they dwell in dependence on us, looking up to us
here. At least let us obtain permission from them. So they can do as they
think [fit].”

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
So then, by which way [led to] those wanderers, by that way Sariputta and
Moggallana approached. Having approached those wanderers, they said this:
“We must go, O friends, to the presence of the Auspicious One. He is our
Teacher, the Auspicious One.” “We dwell in dependence on the
venerables, looking up to the venerables here.  If the venerables will live
the life of purity under the Great Samana, then we will all also live the
life of purity under the Great Samana.”

<p><span class="parno">24</span>
So then, by which way [led to] Sanjaya, the wanderer, by that way Sariputta
and Moggallana approached. Having approached Sanjaya, the wanderer, they
said this: “We must go, O friend, to the presence of the Auspicious
One. He is our Teacher, the Auspicious One.” “Enough, O friends,
do not go. Just all three [of us], we will look after this group.”

<p><span class="parno">25</span>
Also for a second time, Sariputta and Moggallana said this to Sanjaya, the
wanderer: “We must go, O friend, to the presence of the Auspicious
One. He is our Teacher, the Auspicious One.” “Enough, O friends,
do not go. Just all three [of us], we will look after this group.”

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
Also for a third time, Sariputta and Moggallana said this to Sanjaya, the
wanderer: “We must go, O friend, to the presence of the Auspicious
One. He is our Teacher, the Auspicious One.” “Enough, O friends,
do not go. Just all three [of us], we will look after this group.”

<p><span class="parno">27</span>
Then Sariputta and Moggallana, having taking the two hundred and fifty
wanderers, by which way [led to] the Bamboo Grove, by that way they
approached. But hot blood issued from the mouth of Sanjaya, the wanderer,
just there.

<p><span class="parno">28</span>
The Auspicious One saw Sariputta and Moggallana coming from afar. Having
seen, he announced to the bhikkhus: “O bhikkhus, these two friends that
are coming, Kolita and Upatissa, they will be my chief disciples, the
foremost auspicious pair.”

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   Then the Teacher explained more:<br> After [they have] attained liberation at
the Bamboo Grove,<br> the deep sphere of knowledge,<br> the unsurpassed
destruction of appropriations,
</p>

<p><span class="parno"></span>

   “these two friends,<br> that are coming, Kolita and Upatissa,<br> they will
be my chief disciples,<br> the foremost auspicious pair.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">29</span>
So then, by which way [led to] the Auspicious One , by that way Sariputta
and Moggallana approached. Having approached, having bowed down with their
head at the Auspicious One's feet, they said this to the Auspicious One:
“O Bhante, may we gain the going forth in the presence of the Auspicious
One, may we gain the higher ordination.” The Auspicious One said:
“Come, you bhikkhus.” “Well-proclaimed is the Dhamma. Live
the life of purity for rightly making an end of suffering.” Just
[this] was those venerable ones' higher ordination.
