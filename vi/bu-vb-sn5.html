<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>
<h3 class="anunidana1">First sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.229"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Ss.5.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Ss.5.1.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.135"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1220"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time Venerable Udāyī associated with and visited a number of families in Sāvatthī. When he saw a young man without a wife or a young woman without a husband, he would praise the young woman in the presence of the parents of the young man: "The young woman of such-and such a family is beautiful, intelligent, skilled, and diligent. She is suitable for your son." They said: "Bhante, they don’t know who we are. If you would persuade them to give the girl, we would take her for our son."<br>
<br>And he praised the young man in the presence of the parents of the young woman: "The young man of such-and-such a family is handsome, intelligent, skilled, and diligent. He is suitable for your daughter." They said: "Bhante, they don’t know who we are, and we would be ashamed to speak to them for the sake of the girl. But if you would persuade them to ask us, we would give our girl to the young man." In this way he arranged for the taking of a bride, for the <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.230"></a>giving of a bride, and for marriage.</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Ss.5.1.2"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1221"></a>At that time a certain former courtesan had a beautiful daughter. Then some Ājīvaka lay-disciples came from another village and said to that courtesan: "Lady, give your girl for our boy." She replied, "Sirs, I don’t know who you are. And I will not give my only daughter to be taken to another village."<br>
<br>Some people asked them, "Sirs, why have you come here?"<br>
<br>"We are here because we have asked that courtesan to give her daughter for our son, but she refused."<br>
<br>"Why did you ask the courtesan? You should speak to Venerable Udāyī. He will persuade her."</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1222"></a>Those <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.136"></a>Ājīvaka disciples approached Venerable Udāyī and said: "Bhante, we have asked that courtesan here to give her daughter for our son, but she has refused. It would be good, bhante, if you would persuade her to give her daughter."</p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1223"></a>Venerable Udāyī went to that courtesan and said: "Why didn’t you give your daughter to them?"<br>
<br>"I don’t know who they are, Venerable, and I will not give my only daughter to be taken to another village."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.231"></a>"Give her to them. I know them."<br>
<br>"If you know them, bhante, I will give her."<br>
<br>She then gave her daughter to those Ājīvaka disciples, <a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Ss.5.1.3"></a>and they took her away. For a month they treated her like a daughter-in-law, but thereafter like a slave.</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1224"></a>The girl sent a messenger to her mother, saying, "I am miserable and suffering; I have no happiness. For a month they treated me like a daughter-in-law, but after that like a slave. Come, mother, and take me away."<br>
<br>The courtesan went to those Ājīvaka and said: "Sirs, do not treat my girl like a slave; treat her like a daughter-in-law."<br>
<br>"We deal with the ascetic, not with you. Go away! We donʼt know you." Being dismissed she returned to Sāvatthī.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">6</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1225"></a>A second time the girl sent a messenger to her mother, saying, "I am miserable … take me away."<br>
<br>Then that courtesan approached Venerable Udāyī and said: "Bhante, my girl is miserable and suffering; she has no happiness. They treated her like a daughter-in-law for a month<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.232"></a>, but then like a slave. Bhante, please tell them to treat her like a daughter-in-law."</p>

<p><span class="parno">7</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1226"></a>Venerable Udāyī then went to the Ājīvakas and said: "Sirs, do not treat this girl like a slave, but like a daughter-in-law."<br>
<br>"We deal with the courtesan, not with you. An ascetic should not get involved. <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.137"></a> An ascetic should be a good ascetic. Go away! We donʼt know you." Being dismissed he returned to Sāvatthī.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">8</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1227"></a>For a third time that girl sent a messenger to her mother, saying, "I am miserable … take me away." For a second time the courtesan approached Venerable Udāyī and said: "Bhante … tell them to treat her like a daughter-in-law."<br>
<br>"When I went the first time, they dismissed me. Go yourself. I am not going."</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">9</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Ss.5.1.4"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1228"></a>Then that courtesan complained and criticised him: "May Venerable Udāyī be miserable, may he suffer, may he<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.233"></a> have no happiness, just as my girl is miserable, suffering, and has no happiness, because of her nasty mother-in-law, nasty father-in-law, and nasty husband."</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">10-11</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1229"></a>And the girl, too, complained and criticised him in the same way, <a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1230"></a>as did other women who were unhappy with their mothers-in-law, their fathers-in-law, and their husbands.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">12</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1231"></a>But those women who were happy with their mothers-in-law, their fathers-in-law, and their husbands wished him well: "May Venerable Udāyī be happy and well, just as we are happy and well, because of our good mothers-in-law, good fathers-in-law, and good husbands."</p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Ss.5.1.5"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1232"></a>The monks heard that some women were criticising him whereas others were wishing him well. Then the monks of few desires … complained and criticised him: "How can Venerable Udāyī act as a go-between?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1233"></a>They informed the Master. The Master convened the Sangha and questioned Venerable Udāyī:<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.234"></a>"Is it true, Udāyī, that you acted as a go-between?"<br>
<br>"Itʼs true, Master."<br>
<br>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: " … Foolish man, how could you act as a go-between? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3 class="anupannatti1">Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p class="rule"><span class="parno">15</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.138"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1234"></a>"If a monk acts as a go-between on behalf of a man or on behalf of a woman, for marriage or for an affair, he commits an offence entailing suspension."</p>
<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">16</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1235"></a>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3 class="anunidana2">Second sub-story</h3>

<br>She replied: "Sirs, I don’t know who you are. I have much property and many belongings, and I don’t wish to go outside the city. I won’t go."</p>

<p><span class="parno">18</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1237"></a>The messenger informed those men. Then a certain man said to them: "Sirs, why did you ask the prostitute? You should have spoken to Venerable Udāyī. He will persuade her."<br>
<br>A certain lay-follower said: "Donʼt say that. Thatʼs not allowable for the Sakyan ascetics. Venerable Udāyī wonʼt do it." And they made a bet on whether he would.</p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1238"></a>Those low-minded men approached Venerable Udāyī and said: <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.235"></a>"Bhante, while we were enjoying ourselves in the pleasure grove, we sent a messenger to such-and-such a prostitute, asking her to come, but she refused. Would you please persuade her?"</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">20</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1239"></a>Venerable Udāyī went to that prostitute and said: "Why donʼt you go to those men?"<br>
<br>"I donʼt know them, bhante."<br>
<br>"Go to them. I know them."<br>
<br>"If you know them, bhante, I will go." And those low-minded men took her to the pleasure grove.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Ss.5.2.2"></a>Then that lay-follower complained and criticised him: "How can Venerable Udāyī act as a go-between for a one-off relationship?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">21</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1240"></a>The monks heard it, and the monks of few desires complained and criticised him: "How can Venerable Udāyī act as a go-between for a one-off relationship?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">22</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1241"></a>They rebuked Venerable Udāyī in many ways and then <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.139"></a>informed the Master. … "Is it true, Udāyī, that you acted as a go-between for a one-off relationship?"<br>
<br>"Itʼs true, Master."<br>
<br>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: " … Foolish man, how could you act as a go-between for a one-off relationship? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
