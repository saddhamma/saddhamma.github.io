At one time the awakened one, the Lord was staying near Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now at that time wanderers belonging to other sects, having collected together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month, spoke <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, People came up to them to hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. They gained affection for the wanderers belonging to other sects, they gained faith (in them), the wanderers belonging to other sects gained adherents.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.2.1.2" href="#Kd.2.1.2"></a>
Then reasoning arose thus in the mind of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha as he was meditating in seclusion: "At present wanderers belonging to other sects, having collected together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month, speak <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. These people go up to them to hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. They gain affection for the wanderers belonging to other sects, they gain faith (in them), the wanderers belonging to other sects gain adherents. Suppose the masters should also collect together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.2.1.3" href="#Kd.2.1.3"></a>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance, As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha spoke thus to the Lord: "Now, Lord, as I was meditating in seclusion, a reasoning arose in my mind thus: ‘At present wanderers belonging to other sects … should collect together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month?’"<br>
<br>
Then the Lord gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, gladdened, … delighted by the Lord with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, rising from his seat,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.102"></a>
 having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him. Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>
<br>
"<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to assemble together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month.</span>"<br>

Now at that time monks, thinking: "It is allowed by the Lord to assemble together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month," having assembled together, sat down in silence. Those people came up to hear <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>. They looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, having assembled together on the fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the half-month, sit in silence, like dumb pigs? Ought not <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> to be spoken when they are assembled together?" Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>

Then as the Lord was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind thus: "What now if I were to allow those rules of training, laid down by me for monks, (to form) a recital of Pātimokkha for them? It would be a (formal) act of observance for them."<br>
<br>
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.132"></a>
Then the Lord, having emerged from his seclusion in the evening, on this occasion, in this connection having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: "Now, monks, as I was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in my mind thus: ‘What now if I should allow those rules of training, laid down by me for monks, (to form) a recital of Pātimokkha for them? It would be a (formal) act of observance for them’.
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to recite a Pātimokkha.</span><br>

"And thus, monks, should it be recited: The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying:</p>

<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.103"></a>
 announce entire purity. I will recite the Pātimokkha (while) one and all of us present listen properly and pay attention to it. He for whom there may be an offence should reveal it. If there is no offence, you should become silent. By your becoming silent I shall thus know that the venerable ones are quite pure. For as there is an answer for each question, so it is proclaimed up to the third time in an assembly like this. Whatever monk remembering while it is being proclaimed up to the third time that there is an existent offence and should not reveal it, there comes to be conscious lying for him. Now, conscious lying, venerable ones, is a thing called a stumbling-block by the Lord. Therefore the existent offence should be revealed
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.133"></a>
 by a monk who remembers that he has fallen (into an offence) and who desires purity; for when it is revealed there comes to be comfort for him.</span>’"</p>

Now at that time monks, thinking: "The recital of the Pātimokkha on an Observance day is allowed by the Lord," recited the Pātimokkha three times during the half-month—on the fourteenth, on the fifteenth and on the eighth (days) of the half-month. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>

 in the half-month. Whoever should (so) recite it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

<p><span class="parno">10</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.2.5.2." href="#Kd.2.5.2"></a>
Then it occurred to the monks: "A (formal) act of Observance for all together is allowed by the Lord. Now, how far does ‘being all together’ (go)? As far as one residence, or the whole earth?" They told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>Now at that time the venerable Kappina the Great was staying near Rājagaha at Maddakucchi in the deer-park. Then as the venerable Kappina the Great was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind thus: "Should I go to an Observance or should I not go, should I go to a (formal) act of the Order or should I not go, I, nevertheless, am purified with the highest purification."<br>
<br>
Then the Lord, knowing by mind the reasoning in the mind of the venerable Kappina the Great, as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or might bend back his outstretched arm, even so did he, vanishing from Mount Vulture Peak appear in Maddakucchi in the deer-park before the

 venerable Kappina the Great. The Lord sat down on an appointed seat, and the venerable Kappina the Great, having greeted the Lord, sat down at a respectful distance.<br>

As the venerable Kappina the Great was sitting down at a respectful distance the Lord spoke thus to him: "Now, Kappina, as you were meditating in seclusion did not a reasoning arise in your mind thus: ‘Should I go to an Observance or should I not go, should I go to a (formal) act of the Order or should I not go, I, nevertheless, am purified with the highest purification’?" <br>

<br>"Yes, Lord," the venerable Kappina the Great answered the Lord in assent.<br>

Then the Lord, having gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted the venerable Kappina the Great with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend back his outstretched arm, even so did he, vanishing from before the venerable Kappina the Great in Maddakucchi in the deer-park appear on Mount Vulture Peak.

Then it occurred to the monks: "It is laid down by the Lord that ‘being all together’ (means) as far as one residence. Now, how far does one residence (go)?" They told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>

Monks coming for Observance arrived while the Pātimokkha was being recited, and they arrived just after it had been recited, and they stayed (a night) on the way. They told this matter to the Lord.

Now at that time in a certain residence a very small Observance-hall came to be agreed upon. A large Order of monks came to be assembled together on an Observance-day. Monks, sitting on ground that had not been agreed upon, heard the Pātimokkha. Then it occurred to these monks: "It is laid down by the Lord
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.108"></a>
 that the Observance is to be carried out having agreed upon an Observance-hall, but we heard the Pātimokkha while we were sitting on ground that was not agreed upon. Now was the Observance carried out for us or was it not carried out?" They told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>

He is one who does not come aright.<br>
<br>
"In a case, monks, where this madman now remembers the Observance, now does not remember it … now comes for a (formal) act of the Order, now does not come for it,
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to give the agreement for a madman to such a madman.</span><br>

And thus, monks, should it be given: The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying:</p>

If it seems right to the Order, the Order should give the agreement for a madman to the mad monk Gagga, so that whether the monk Gagga remembers the Observance or does not remember it, whether he remembers a (formal) act of the Order or does not remember it, whether he comes for the Observance or does not come for it, whether he comes for a (formal) act of the Order or does not come for it, the Order either with Gagga or without Gagga can carry out the Observance, can carry out a (formal) act of the Order.
