Now at that time two monks were going along a high road in the Kosalan country. Ore monk indulged in bad habits. The other monk spoke thus to that monk: "Do not do that, your reverence, it is not allowable." He grumbled at him. Then that monk, tormented by thirst, spoke thus to the monk who had grumbled: "Give me the strainer, your reverence, I will drink (some) water." The monk who had grumbled did not give it. That monk passed away, tormented by thirst. Then that monk, having arrived at a monastery, told this matter to the monks. They said: "But did you, your reverence, (although) being asked, not give a strainer?"<br>
<br>"No, your reverences." Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can this monk, when being asked for a strainer, not give it?" Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having had the Order of monks convened, questioned this monk, saying:<br>
<br>"Is it true, as is said, that you, monk, when being asked for a strainer, did not give it?"<br>
<br>"It is true, Lord." The enlightened one, the Lord rebuked him, saying:<br>
<br>
"It is not suitable in you, foolish man, it is not becoming, it is not fitting, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable,
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.163"></a>
it is not to be done. How can you, foolish man, when being asked for a strainer, not give it? It is not,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.119"></a>
 foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … " Having rebuked him, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:<br>

<span class="rule">Monks, if a monk is going along a highroad and is being asked for a strainer, he should not not give it. Whoever should not give it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="rule">Nor, monks, should you go along a highway without a strainer.

Then the Lord, walking on tour gradually arrived at Vesālī. The Lord stayed there in Vesālī in the Great Grove at the Hall of the Gabled Pillars. Now at that time monks were making repairs.

Jīvaka Komārabhacca saw the monks who were very ill with their bodies full of (bad) humours; seeing them, he approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to the Lord:<br>

"At present, Lord, monks are very ill with their bodies full of (bad) humours. It were well, Lord, if the Lord allowed the monks a place for pacing up and down in and a bathroom.

For, friend Vaḍḍha, in the discipline of the noble, this is growth: whoever having seen a transgression as a transgression, confesses it according to the rule, he attains restraint in the future."<br>
<br>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Well, now monks, let the Order set upright the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl, let it grant eating with the Order.
</p>

<p><span class="parno">112</span>Monks, if a lay-follower is possessed of eight qualities his bowl may be set upright: if he does not try for non-receiving (of gains) by monks, if he does not try for non-profiting by monks, if he does not try for non-residence for monks, if he does not revile and abuse monks, if he does not cause monk to break with monk, if he does not speak dispraise of the Awakened One, if he does not speak dispraise of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, if he does not speak dispraise of the Order. I allow you, monks, to set upright a lay-follower’s bowl if he is possessed of these eight qualities.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.15.20.7" href="#Kd.15.20.7"></a>
"And thus, monks, should it be set upright: Monks, that Licchavi Vaḍḍha, having approached the Order, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having honoured the monks’ feet, having sat down on his haunches, having saluted them with joined palms, should speak thus to them: ‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, my bowl was turned upside down by the Order, I am not eating with the Order. But I, honoured sirs, am conducting myself properly, I am subdued, I am mending my ways, and I ask the Order for the setting upright of the bowl.</span>’ And a second time it should be asked for.

If the setting upright of the Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl and the granting of eating with the Order is pleasing to the venerable ones, they should be silent; he to whom it is not pleasing should speak.
</p>

<p><span class="parno">115</span>The Licchavi Vaḍḍha’s bowl is set upright by the Order (and there is) eating with the Order. It is pleasing to the Order; therefore it is silent. Thus do I understand this.’"</p>

Then the Lord, having stayed in Vesālī for as long as he found suiting, set out on tour for the Bhaggas. In due course, walking on tour, the Lord arrived at the Bhaggas. The Lord stayed there among the Bhaggas on Suṃsumāra Hill in the Bhesakaḷā Grove in the deer park. Now at that time Kokanada was the name of Prince Bodhi’s palace; it had not long been built and was as yet uninhabited by recluse or brahmin or by any human creature. Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahmin youth, the son of Sañjikā, saying: "Come along, good son of Sañjikā, go up to the Lord; having gone up, in my name salute the Lord’s feet with your head, ask whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort, and say: ‘Lord, Prince Bodhi salutes the Lord’s feet with his head and asks whether he is well … abiding in comfort,’ and says this: ‘Lord, may the Lord consent to a meal with Prince Bodhi tomorrow together with the Order of monks.’"<br>
<br>
"Very well, good sir," and the brahmin youth, Sañjikā’s son, having answered Prince Bodhi in assent, approached the Lord; having approached, having exchanged greetings with the Lord, having conversed in a courteous and friendly way, sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the brahmin youth, the son of Sanjika, spoke thus to the Lord: "Prince Bodhi salutes the revered Gotama’s feet with his head … and says may the revered Gotama consent to a meal with Prince Bodhi tomorrow together with the Order of monks." The Lord consented by becoming silent.<br>
<br>
Then the brahmin youth, Sañjikā’s son, having understood the Lord’s consent, rising from his seat approached Prince Bodhi;
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.128"></a>
 having approached, he spoke thus to Prince Bodhi: "I spoke, good sir, in your name to the Lord Gotama, saying: ‘Prince Bodhi salutes … together with the Order of monks.’ And the recluse Gotama consented."
</p>

<p><span class="parno">117</span>Then Prince Bodhi towards the end of that night, having had sumptuous foods, solid and soft, prepared, and having had Kokanada palace strewn with white cloths as far as the last flight of stairs, spoke thus to the brahmin youth, the son of Sañjikā: "Come you along, good fellow, approach the Lord; having approached, announce the time to the Lord, saying: ‘It is time, Lord, the meal is ready.’"<br>
<br>"Very well, good sir," and the brahmin youth, Sañjikā’s son, having answered Prince Bodhi in assent, approached the Lord; having approached, he announced the time to the Lord, saying: "It is time, good Gotama, the meal is ready."
</p>

<p><span class="parno">118</span>Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached Prince Bodhi’s dwelling. Now at the time when the Lord was coming Prince Bodhi was standing at the porch of the outside gateway. Prince Bodhi saw the Lord coming in the distance, and seeing him, having gone from there to meet him, having greeted the Lord, having honoured him, he approached Kokanada palace. Then the Lord stood still at the last flight of stairs. Then Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord:<br>
<br>
"Lord, let the Lord tread on the cloths, let the well-farer <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.178"></a>
tread on the cloths so that it may be for a long time for my blessing and happiness." When he had spoken thus the Lord became silent. And a second time … And a third time Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, let the Lord tread on … for my blessing and happiness." Then the Lord looked towards the venerable Ānanda. Then the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to Prince Bodhi:<br>
<br>"Let the cloths, prince, be packed away, the Lord will not tread upon the cloth carpeting, the Truth-finder has compassion for the folk who come after."</p>

<p><span class="parno">119</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.15.21.3" href="#Kd.15.21.3"></a>
Then Prince Bodhi, having had the cloths packed away, had a seat made ready upstairs in Kokanada. Then the Lord having ascended the Kokanada palace, sat down together with the Order of monks on the seat made ready. Then Prince Bodhi, having with his own hand served and satisfied with sumptuous foods, solid and soft, the Order of monks with the Awakened One at its head, when the Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, sat down at a respectful distance. Then the Lord, having gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted Prince Bodhi as he was sitting at a respectful distance with talk on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.129"></a>
 rising from his seat, departed. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: "<span class="rule">Monks, you should not tread on a cloth carpeting. Whoever should tread on one, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>"</p>

Now at that time a certain woman who had had a miscarriage, having invited monks, having had cloth prepared, spoke thus: "Revered sirs, tread on the cloth." The monks, being scrupulous, did not tread on it. She said: "Revered
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.179"></a>
 sirs, tread on the cloth for good luck’s sake." The monks, being scrupulous, did not tread on it. Then that woman spread it about, saying: "How can these masters (although) being asked for good luck’s sake not tread on the cloth carpeting?" Monks heard this woman who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said: "Householders, monks, look out for lucky signs.
<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, when being asked by householders for good luck’s sake, to tread on a cloth carpeting.</span>"<br>

Then the Lord having stayed among the Bhaggas for as long as he found suiting set out on tour for Sāvatthī. Walking on tour in due course he arrived at Sāvatthī. The Lord stayed there at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, taking a small jar and a (clay foot-) scrubber and a broom, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, she sat down at a respectful distance. As she was sitting down at a respectful distance, Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, may the Lord accept my little jar and (clay foot-) scrubber and broom so that it may be for a long time for my blessing and happiness." The Lord accepted the little jar and the broom; the Lord did not accept the (clay foot-) scrubber. Then the Lord gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, with talk on

"These, masters, are not monks, they are wanderers." They made a bet as to whether they were monks or not. Then that lay-follower, having recognised them as they came up, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can these revered sirs <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.131"></a>

Now at the time when Kassapa of Uruvelā went forth many copper goods, wooden goods, clay goods accrued to the Order. Then it occurred to the monks: "Now, what copper goods are allowed by the Lord, what are not allowed? What wooden goods are allowed, what are not allowed? What clay goods are allowed, what are not allowed?" They told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, all copper goods except a weapon; all wooden goods except a sofa, <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.143"></a>
 a divan, a wooden bowl, wooden shoes; all clay goods except a (clay-foot-) scrubber and a large earthen vessel.</span>"</p>
