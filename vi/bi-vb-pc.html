<p><a class="pts_pn"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bi-Pc.1.1.1">Bi-Pc.1.1.1"></a> <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.3.243"></a> These hundred and sixty-six matters, ladies, that are offences of expiation come up for recitation.</p>

<p>At that time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the Order of nuns was offered garlic by a certain lay-follower,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><span class="ref">Ja.no.136</span> (<span class="ref">Ja.1.474</span>) is based on this story.</span></span></span> saying: “If these ladies need garlic, I (can supply them) with garlic."<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><em>Cf.</em> <a class="cr" href="#Vin.3.244">Vin.3.244"></a> (<a class="cr" href="#BD.2.118"></a>).</span></span></span> And the keeper of the field was instructed (with the words): “If the nuns come, give two or three bundles<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi">bhaṇḍike</i>, explained at <span class="ref">Vin-a.919</span> that this is a synonym for <i lang="pi">poṭṭalike sampuṇṇamiñjānaṃ</i>. As <i lang="pi">poṭṭalika</i> (several variant readings) appears to mean a kind of grass, perhaps the phrase here stands for “two or three leaves from full bulbs." At <span class="ref">Ja.1.474</span> the reading is <i lang="pi">gaṇḍikā</i>, a stalk or stick. At <span class="ref">Vin-a.920</span> it is said “So too is this <i lang="pi">bhaṇḍikalasuṇa</i> (garlic in the bundle), it is not one, two (or) three bulbs (<i lang="pi">miñjaka</i>)." <i lang="pi">Miñjā</i>, according to <span class="author">Geiger</span>, <cite class="book">Pali Literature und Sprache, § 9</cite> = <i lang="pi">majjā</i> (pith, sap); <i lang="pi">a-miñjaka</i>, according to <cite class="book">Critical Pali Dictionary</cite> is “without tuber." But onions, garlic and leeks are bulbous plants. It seems that the nuns were to be given the garlic done up into bundles, rather than the bulbous parts themselves.</span></span></span> to each nun." Now at that time there was a festival in Sāvatthī; the garlic was used up as soon as it was brought in.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">See <cite class="book">Pali-English Dictionary</cite> under <i lang="pi">yathābhataṃ</i>. <span class="ref">Ja.1.475</span> makes out that the nuns went to the lay-follower’s house where the garlic had been brought from the field. This would explain his injunction to them to go to the field.</span></span></span> The nuns, having approached that lay-follower, spoke thus: “Sir, we have need of garlic." He said: “There is none, ladies; the garlic is used up as soon as it is brought in; go to the field." The nun Thullanandā, having gone to the field, not knowing moderation, had much garlic taken away. The keeper of the field looked <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.3.244"></a> down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns, not knowing moderation, have much garlic taken away?" Nuns heard that keeper of the field who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>

<p>"How can the lady Thullanandā, not knowing moderation, have much garlic taken away?" …</p>

<p>"Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā, not knowing moderation, had much garlic taken away?"</p>

<p>"It is true, lord."</p>

<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>

<p>"How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā, not knowing moderation, have much garlic taken away? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … " and having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"Formerly, monks, the nun Thullanandā was the wife of a certain brahmin <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.259"></a> and there were three daughters, Nandā, Nandavatī, Sundarīnandā.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><em>Cf.</em> <a class="cr" href="#Vin.4.211">Vin.4.211"></a> where these appear as the sisters of Thullanandā.</span></span></span> Then, monks, that brahmin, having passed away, was born in the womb of a certain goose<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i lang="pi">haṃsa</i>, or swan; “mallard" at <span class="ref">Jātaka translation 1.293</span>.</span></span></span> and his feathers were made all of gold. He gave a feather one by one to these. Then, monks, the nun Thullanandā, saying: ‘This goose is giving us a feather one by one,’ having taken hold of that king of the geese, plucked him. His feathers, on growing again, turned out white. So at that time, monks, the nun Thullanandā lost the gold through too much greed; now she will lose the garlic."</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"One should be pleased with what is received,<br>
 for too much greed is bad.<br>
By taking hold of the king of the geese, <br>
one may lose the gold."</p>
</blockquote><br>

<p>Then the lord having in many a figure rebuked the nun Thullanandā for her difficulty in maintaining herself … " … And thus, monks, the nuns should set forth this rule of training:</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.3.245"></a> “<span class="rule">Whatever nun should eat garlic, there is an offence of expiation.</span>"<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><span class="ref">Ja.1.476</span> points out that this prohibition, affecting all the nuns, is due to Thullanandā’s greed. At <a class="cr" href="#Vin.2.140">Vin.2.140"></a> it is made a <i lang="pi">dukkaṭa</i> offence for monks to eat garlic; nor should Jain monks accept it (<span class="ref"><i lang="pi">Āyāraṃgasutta</i> 2 1, 8.13</span>).</span></span></span></p>
