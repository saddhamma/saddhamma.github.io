<h3 id="nidana">Origin story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-NP.22.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-NP.22.1.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.118"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. At that time a potter had invited the monks: “Whoever of the Venerables needs a bowl, I will provide it." But the monks lacked a sense of moderation and they asked for many bowls. Those who had small bowls asked for large ones, and those who had large bowls asked for small ones. The potter was so busy making bowls for the monks that he was not able to make other goods for sale. He could not make a living for himself, and his wife and children suffered. People grumbled and complained: “How can the Sakyan ascetics not have any sense of moderation and ask for many bowls? This potter is so busy making bowls for them <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.245"></a> that he is not able to make other goods for sale. He is unable to make a living for himself, and his wife and children are suffering."</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticised those monks: “How can those monks not have a sense of moderation and ask for many bowls?"</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
After criticising those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that some monks do not have a sense of moderation and ask for many bowls?" “It’s true, Master." The Buddha, the Master, criticised them: “ … How can those foolish men not have a sense of moderation and ask for many bowls? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.119"></a> After criticising them, he spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks: “<span class="subrule">Monks, a monk should not ask for a bowl. If he does, he commits an offence of bad conduct.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-NP.22.1.2"></a>Soon afterwards the bowl of a certain monk broke. Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited asking for a bowl, and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not ask for new one. As a consequence he collected almsfood with his hands. People grumbled and complained: “How can the Sakyan ascetics collect almsfood with their hands, just like members of other sects?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Monks heard the complaints of those people and they informed the Master. The Master spoke on the Dhamma and then address the monks: “<span class="subrule">Monks, I allow you to ask for a new bowl if your bowl has been lost or broken.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-NP.22.1.3"></a>When they knew about the Master’s allowance, some monks belonging to the group of six <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.120"></a> asked for many bowls even when their existing bowls only had a minor chip or scratch. Then that potter was once again so busy making bowls for the monks that he was unable to make other goods for sale. He could not make a living for himself, and his wife and children suffered. And people grumbled and complained as before.</p>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>
Monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticised those monks: “How can those monks belonging to the group of six <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.246"></a> ask for many bowls even if their existing bowls only have a minor chip or scratch?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
After criticising those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that you ask for many bowls even if your existing bowls only have a minor chip or scratch?" “It’s true, Master." The Buddha, the Master, criticised them: “ … Foolish men, how can you ask for many bowls even if your existing bowls only have a minor chip or scratch? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3 id="pannatti">Final ruling</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">9</span>
“If a monk gets another new bowl in exchange for a bowl with less than five mends, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. That monk should relinquish that bowl to an assembly of monks. He is then to be given the last bowl belonging <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.121"></a> to that assembly: ‘Monk, this is your bowl; keep it until it breaks.’ This is the proper procedure."</p>

<h3 id="pada">Definitions</h3>

<p><span class="parno">10</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-NP.22.2"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-NP.22.2.1"></a>A: whoever …  Monk:  … The monk who is ordained by a complete Sangha through a procedure of one motion and three announcements, which is unchallengeable and fit to stand; this sort of monk is meant in this case.</p>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>With less than five mends: it has no mends, one mend, two mends, three mends, or four mends. A mend that does not count: it is so called if the fault is less than 4 centimetres long. A mend that counts: it is so called if the fault is 4 centimetres long.<br>

<br>New bowl: newly asked for.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>Gets [ … ] in exchange: in the act of asking, he commits an offence of bad conduct. When he gets the bowl, it becomes subject to relinquishment.<br>

<br>It is to be relinquished in the midst of the Sangha. All determined bowls should be brought together. One should not determine an inferior bowl, thinking, “I will get a valuable bowl." <span class="subrule">If one determines an inferior bowl, thinking, “I will get a valuable bowl," one commits an <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.122"></a> offence of bad conduct.</span><br>

<br>“And, monks, it is to be relinquished in this way. After approaching the Sangha, that monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay homage at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his haunches, put the palms of his hands together, and say: ‘<span class="kamma">Bhante, this bowl which I got in exchange for a bowl which had less than five mends is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.</span>’" After relinquishing it, he is to confess the offence. The confession should be received by an experienced and competent monk.<br>

<br>A monk who has five qualities is to be chosen as the bowl-distributor: one who is not swayed by desire, anger, delusion, or fear, and who knows what distributing and not distributing refer to. <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.247"></a> “And, monks, this is how he should be chosen. First the monk should be asked and then an experienced and competent monk should inform the Sangha:</p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>“‘Bhante, let the Sangha listen to me. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should choose monk so-and-so as the bowl-distributor. This is the motion.</p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>“‘Bhante, let the Sangha listen to me. The Sangha chooses monk so-and-so as the bowl-distributor. Any monk who agrees to choosing monk so-and-so as the bowl-distributor should remain silent. Any monk who does not agree should say so.</p>

<p><span class="parno">15</span>“‘The Sangha has chosen monk so-and-so as <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.123"></a> the bowl-distributor. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’"</p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>The chosen monk should distribute that bowl. He should tell the most senior monk: “Bhante, would you like this bowl?" If the most senior monk takes it, his bowl is to be offered to the next monk. <span class="subrule">He should not not take that bowl out of sympathy. If he does, he commits an offence of bad conduct.</span> It is not to be offered to anyone who does not have bowl. In this manner it is to be offered all the way to the most junior monk in the Sangha.<br>

<br>He is then to be given the last bowl belonging to that assembly of monks: ‘Monk, this is your bowl; keep it until it breaks’:</p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>That monk is not to store that bowl in an unsuitable place, to use it in an unsuitable way, or to give it <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.124"></a> away, thinking, “How may this bowl be lost, destroyed, or broken?" <span class="subrule">If he stores it in an unsuitable place, uses it in an unsuitable way, or gives it away, he commits an offence of bad conduct."</span></p>

<p><span class="parno">18</span>This is the proper procedure: this is in right method.
