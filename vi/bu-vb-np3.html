<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>

<p><span class="parno">1</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-NP.3.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-NP.3.1.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.24"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1921"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍikaʼs Park. At that time a certain monk had been offered robe cloth<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i>Cīvara</i> means both a finished robe and any cloth that can be used to make a robe. Thus I vary my translation with the context.</span></span></span> outside of the robe season. While he was making the robe, he realised there was not enough cloth. <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.203"></a> Lifting it up, he smoothed it out again and again.
<span class="note"> <span class="details"><span class="p">The point, according to the commentary, is that he was trying to increase its size.</span></span></span><br>
<br>While inspecting the lodgings, the Master saw that monk acting in this way. He approached him and said: "Monk, what are you doing?"<br>
<br>"Bhante, I have received this robe cloth outside of the robe season, but itʼs not enough to make a robe. This is why I lift it up and smooth it out again and again."<br>
<br>"Do you expect to receive more cloth?"<br>
<br>"I do, Master."<br>
<br>The Master then spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks: "Monks, I allow you to keep robe cloth if you expect to receive more."</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-NP.3.1.2"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.25"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1922"></a>When they knew that the Master had given this allowance, some monks kept robe cloth for over a month, even though it was outside the robe season. They kept it tied up in a bundle on a robe rack.<br>
<br>While inspecting the lodgings, Venerable Ānanda saw that robe cloth, and he asked the monks: "Whose robe cloth is this?"<br>
<br>"It is our out-of-season robe cloth, which we are keeping because we are expecting more cloth."<br>
<br>"How long have you kept this cloth?"<br>
<br>"Over a month."</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>Venerable Ānanda complained and criticised them: "How can these monks keep out-of-season robe cloth for over a month?"<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1923"></a>After criticising those monks in many ways, Venerable Ānanda informed the Master. … "Is it true, monks, that some monks keep out-of-season robe cloth for over a month?"<br>
<br>"Itʼs true, Master."<br>
<br>The Buddha, the Master, criticised them: " … How could these foolish men keep out-of-season robe cloth for over a month? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2 class="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>

<p><span class="parno">4</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1924"></a>"When his robe is finished and the <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.26"></a> <i>kathina</i> period has ended, if out-of-season robe cloth is offered to a monk, he may receive it if he wishes. If he receives it, he should quickly make a robe. If there is not enough cloth, but he expects to get more, he should keep it at most one month to make up the lack. If he keeps it beyond that, even if he expects more cloth, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession."</p>

<br>If he receives the expected robe cloth on the same day as when he received the original robe cloth, it must be made into a robe within ten days. If he receives the expected robe cloth two days after

<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Pali idiom is such that this means on the day after he received the original piece of cloth. (Cf. the definition of ten days in Relinquishment 1, where the eleventh dawn means the tenth dawn after one received the cloth.) The way this works, it seems, is that the day on which the cloth was received counts as one.</span></span></span> he received the original robe cloth, it must be made into a robe within ten days. If he receives the expected robe cloth three days after … four days after … five days after … six days after … seven days after … eight days after … nine days after … ten days after … eleven days after … twelve days after … thirteen days after … fourteen days after … fifteen days after … sixteen days after … seventeen days after … eighteen days after <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.28"></a> … nineteen days after … twenty days after he received the original robe cloth, it must be made into a robe within ten days. If he receives the expected robe cloth twenty-one days after he received the original robe cloth, it must be made into a robe within nine days. If he receives the expected robe cloth twenty-two days after he received the original robe cloth, it must be made into a robe within eight days. … twenty-three days after … twenty-four days after … twenty-five days after … twenty-six days after … twenty-seven days after … twenty-eight days after … twenty-nine days … thirty days. <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Again, according to the commentarial way of counting this refers to the twenty-ninth dawn after the original cloth was received. See the previous note.</span></span></span> after he received the original robe cloth, it must be determined, placed under shared ownership, or given away on that very day. If he does not determine it, place it under shared ownership, or give it away, he commits the offence entailing relinquishment at dawn on the thirty-first day. <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">That is, on the thirtieth dawn after he received the robe.
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.205"></a> </span></span></span>The robe is to be relinquished to a Sangha, a group, or an individual.

<br>"And, monks, it is to be relinquished in this way. … <span class="add">To be expanded as in Relinquishment 1, MS paragraphs <span class="ref">1873–1877</span>, with appropriate substitutions.</span> … ʻBhante, this out-of-season robe cloth of mine, which I have kept for more than a month, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.ʼ … the Sangha should give … the Venerables should give … ʻI give this robe back to the Venerable.ʼ"</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">16</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-NP.3.2.3"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1936"></a>If he receives the expected robe cloth, but it is different from the robe cloth originally received, and there are days remaining, he does not have to make a robe against his wishes.</p>
<h2 class="cakka">Permutations</h2>

<p><span class="parno">17</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1937"></a>If it is more than a month and he perceives it as more than a month, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is more than a month, but he has doubts about it, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is more than a month, but he perceives it as less than a month, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession.<br>
<br>If it is undetermined, but he perceives it as determined, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is not placed under shared ownership, but he perceives it as placed under shared ownership, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.29"></a> If it is not given away, but he perceives it as given away, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is not lost, but he perceives it as lost, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is not destroyed, but he perceives it as destroyed, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is not burnt, but he perceives it as burnt, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is not stolen, but he perceives it as stolen, he commits an offence entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>

<p><span class="parno">18</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1938"></a>If he uses a robe which is to be relinquished without first relinquishing it, he commits an offence of bad conduct. If it is less than a month, but he perceives it as more than a month, he commits an offence of bad conduct. If it is less than a month, but he has doubts about it, he commits an offence of bad conduct. If it is less than a month and he perceives it as less than a month, there is no offence.</p>
<h2 class="anapatti">Non-offences</h2>

<p><span class="parno">19</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-NP.3.2.4"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1939"></a>There is no offence: if within a month it is determined, placed under shared ownership, given away, lost, destroyed, burnt, stolen, or taken on trust; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.</p>

<p><span class="parno">20</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.1940"></a>The third rule, the third training rule on the <i>kathina</i> period, is finished.</p>
