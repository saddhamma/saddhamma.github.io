<p>At one time the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain lay-follower, having given a store-room<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">uddosita</i> = <i lang="pi">bhaṇḍasālā</i> (<span class="ref">Vin-a.906</span>). <i lang="pi">Uddosita</i> is sometimes a stable; <em>cf.</em> <a class="cr" href="#Vin.3.200">Vin.3.200"></a>, and <span class="ref"><cite class="book">Vinaya Texts</cite> iii.363, n.2</span>. At <a class="cr" href="#Vin.2.278">Vin.2.278"></a> <i lang="pi">uddosita</i> is “allowed," a lay-follower again being recorded to give one to an Order of nuns.</span></span></span> to an Order of nuns, passed away. He had two sons, one of no faith, not believing,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">appasanna</i>, or not pleased (with the master’s teaching).</span></span></span> the other with faith, believing. Then he of no faith, not believing, spoke thus to him with faith, believing: “The store-room is ours, let us deal it out."<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">bhājāma</i>; Sinhalese edition reads <i lang="pi">bhājema</i>.</span></span></span> When he had spoken thus, the one with faith, believing, spoke thus to him of no faith, not believing: “Do not, sir, speak thus; it was given to the Order of nuns by our father." And a second time he of no faith, not believing, spoke thus to him with faith, believing: “The storeroom is ours, let us deal it out." Then the one with faith, believing, spoke thus to him of no faith, not believing: “Do not, sir, speak thus; it was given to the Order of nuns by our father." And a third time he of no faith … “ …  let us deal it out." Then the one with faith, believing, thinking," If it became mine, I also would give it to an Order of nuns," spoke thus to the one of no faith, not believing: “Let us deal it out." Then that store-room being dealt out by these, <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.3.178"></a> fell to<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">pāpuṇāti</i>, to reach, attain, arrive at, to obtain to.</span></span></span> him of no faith, not believing. Then the one of no faith, not believing, having approached the nuns, spoke thus: “You must depart, ladies, the store-room is ours." When he had spoken thus, the nun Thullanandā spoke thus to that man:</p>

<p>"Do not, sir, speak thus; the store-room was given to the Order of nuns by your father."</p>

<p>Saying: “Was it given<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> Square brackets in text, but Sinhalese edition reads <i lang="pi">dinno na dinno</i>.</span></span></span> (or) not given?" they asked the chief ministers of justice. The chief ministers spoke thus:</p>

<p>"Who knows, ladies, if it was given to the Order of nuns?" When they had spoken thus, the nun Thullanandā spoke thus to these chief ministers: <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.224"></a> </p>

<p>"But, masters, was not the gift seen or heard of by you as it was being given, eye-witnesses having been arranged?" Then the chief ministers, saying: “What the lady says is true," made over the store-room to the Order of nuns. Then that man, defeated, looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying:</p>

<p>"These shaven-headed (women) are not (true) recluses, they are strumpets.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <em>Cf.</em> below, <a class="cr" href="#BD.3.257"></a>, <a class="cr" href="#BD.3.275"></a>. The word translated as “strumpets" is <i lang="pi">bandhakiniyo</i>; <em>cf.</em> <span class="ref">Ja.5.425</span>.</span></span></span> How can they have the store-room taken away from us?" The nun Thullanandā told this matter to the chief ministers. The chief ministers had that man punished.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">daṇḍāpesum</i>, perhaps beaten with a stick.</span></span></span> Then that man, punished,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">daṇḍika</i>.</span></span></span> having had a sleeping-place made for Naked Ascetics not far from the nunnery, instigated the Naked Ascetics, saying: “Talk down<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">accāvadatha</i>. <span class="ref">Vin-a.906</span> says <i lang="pi">atikkamitvā vadatha, akkosatha</i>, having surpassed them, talk, swear at them.</span></span></span> these nuns." The nun Thullanandā told this matter to the chief ministers. The chief ministers had that man fettered. People looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns have a store-room taken away (from him) and secondly have him punished and <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.3.179"></a> thirdly have him fettered? Now they will have him killed."</p>

<p>Nuns heard these people as they … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā be one who speaks in envy?"<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">ussayavādikā</i>.</span></span></span> Then these nuns told this matter to the monks  … </p>

<p>"Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā is one who speaks in envy?"</p>

<p>"It is true, lord."</p>

<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>

<p>"How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā be one who speaks in envy? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:</p>

<p>"<span class="rule">Whatever nun should be one who speaks in envy concerning a householder or a householder’s sons (or brothers<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> See Old Commentary below.</span></span></span>) or a slave or a workman<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">kammakāra</i>, or servant.</span></span></span> and even concerning a wanderer who is a recluse,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">samaṇaparibbājaka</i>.</span></span></span> that nun has fallen into a matter that is an offence at once,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">paṭhamāpattikaṃ</i>, which in <a class="cr" href="#Bi-Sn.1">Bi-Sn.1"></a> –<a class="cr" href="#Bi-Sn.6">Bi-Sn.6"></a> is in opposition to <i lang="pi">yāvatatiyaka</i>, that which is not an offence until a nun has been admonished up to the third time (see <a class="cr" href="#Bu-Ss.7">Bu-Ss.7"></a> –<a class="cr" href="#Bu-Ss.10">Bu-Ss.10"></a>). <em>Cf.</em> <a class="cr" href="#Vin.3.186">Vin.3.186"></a> (= <a class="cr" href="#BD.1.328"></a>).</span></span></span> entailing a formal meeting of the Order involving being sent away."<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">nissāraṇīyaṃ saṅghādisesaṃ</i>; <em>cf.</em> the similar construction, <i lang="pi">nissaggiyaṃ pācittiyaṃ</i>, and see <a class="cr" href="#BD.3.xxxvi">BD.3, Introduction, p.xxxvi</a>.</span></span></span></span></p>

Neither did the nuns wish to let her go forth. Having approached the nun Thullanandā, having shown (her) the belongings, she asked for the going forth. The nun Thullanandā, having taken the belongings, let her go forth. Then that Licchavi, searching for that woman, having gone to Sāvatthī, seeing her gone forth among the nuns, approached King Pasenadi of Kosala; <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.226"></a> having approached, he spoke thus to King Pasenadi of Kosala:</p>

<p>"Sire, my wife, taking precious belongings, has reached Sāvatthī; let the king<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">devo</i></span></span></span> allow me power over her."</p>

<p>"Well now, good sir, having examined<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">vicinitvā</i>.</span></span></span> (her), explain." </p>

<p>"Sire, she was seen gone forth among the nuns."</p>

<p>"My dears,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">amma</i>.</span></span></span> a family of her relations are in such and such a village; having gone there, look for her."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Bi-Sn.3.2"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bi-Sn.3.2.1">Bi-Sn.3.2.1"></a> At that time two nuns were going along the high-road from Sāketa to Sāvatthī. On the way there was a river to be crossed.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <em>Cf.</em> <a class="cr" href="#Vin.4.65">Vin.4.65"></a>.</span></span></span> Then these nuns, having approached a boatman, spoke thus:</p>

<p>"Please, sir, take us across."</p>

<p>Saying, “I am not able, ladies, to take both across at once," he made one cross alone with him<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"> <i lang="pi">eko ekaṃ uttāresi</i>. <em>Cf.</em> <i lang="pi">eko ekāya</i> in the <i lang="pi">Aniyatas</i>, <a class="cr" href="#Vin.3.187">Vin.3.187<em>ff.</em></a> meaning, the one (a monk) with the other (a woman); here meaning a man (<i lang="pi">eko</i>) and a nun (<i lang="pi">ekaṃ</i>). They crossed alone together. In Monks’ <a class="cr" href="#Bu-Pc.28">Bu-Pc.28"></a> it is evidently thought safer to allow a nun to cross a river with a monk than to wait behind on the bank.</span></span></span>; one who was across seduced the one who was across, one who was not across seduced the one who was not across. These, having met afterwards, asked (one another): “I hope that you, lady, were not violated?"</p>

<p>"I was violated, lady. But were you violated, lady?"</p>

<p>"I was violated, lady." Then these nuns, having arrived at Sāvatthī, told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying :</p>

<p>"How can a nun go to the other side of a river alone?" Then these nuns told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>

<p>"Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun went to the other side of a river alone?"</p>

<p>"It is true, lord."</p>

<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>

A certain nun there was beautiful, good to look upon, charming. A certain man came to be in love with that nun on account of her appearance. Then that man, appointing a sleeping-place for those nuns, <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.229"></a> appointed a sleeping-place at one side for this nun.

Then that man, having come during the night, searching for that nun, knocked against the nuns. The nuns, not seeing this nun, spoke thus: “Doubtless this nun has gone out together with the man."</p>

<p>Then this nun, at the end of that night, approached those nuns. The nuns spoke thus to that nun: “Why did you, lady, go out together with the man?"</p>

<p>Saying: “Ladies, I did not go out together with the man," she told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can a nun be away for a night alone  … </p>

If, when the nun has performed the <i lang="pi">mānatta</i> discipline, the Order of nuns should number twenty, then that nun may be rehabilitated. But if the Order of nuns, numbering less than twenty even by one, should rehabilitate that nun, that nun is not rehabilitated, and those nuns are blameworthy; this is the proper course there. Concerning this, I ask the ladies: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? The ladies are quite pure in this matter, therefore they are silent; thus do I understand this.</p>
