<h2 id="nidana">Origin story</h2>

<p><span class="parno">1</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.2.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.2.1.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.171"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time some monks belonging to the group of six were arguing with and abusing good monks. They reviled and insulted them about their caste, name, family, work, trade, illnesses, physical traits, defilements, and offences, and by calling them names. The monks of few desires … complained and criticised them: “How can those monks belonging to the group of six argue with and abuse good monks<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.5"></a>? How can they revile and insult them about their caste, name, family, work, trade, illnesses, physical traits, defilements, and offences, and by calling them names?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
After criticising those monks in many ways, they informed the Master. … “Is it true, monks, that you treat good monks in this way?" “It’s true, Master." The Buddha, the Master, criticised them: “ … Foolish men, how can you argue with and abuse good monks? How can you revile <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.172"></a> and insult them about their caste, name, family, work, trade, illnesses, physical traits, defilements, and offences, and by calling them names? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … " … and after criticising them … he spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks:</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.2.1.2"></a>“Once upon a time, monks, there was a brahman in Takkasilā who had an ox called Nandivisāla. On one occasion the ox said to the brahman: “Go, brahman, and make the following bet worth one thousand coins with the head merchant: ‘My ox will pull one hundred carts tied together.’" And that brahman did just that. Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking Nandivisāla to them, he said: “Go, you fraud; pull, you liar." But Nandivisāla just stood right there.<br>

<br>Then that brahman became depressed because he had lost one thousand coins. And Nandivisāla said to him: “Why are you depressed?"<br>

<br>“Because I lost one thousand coins because of you."<br>

<br>“But why did you disgrace me by calling me a fraud when I’m not? Now go, brahman, and make the same bet worth two thousand coins with the head merchant. But don’t disgrace me by calling me a fraud." Once again that brahman did just that. Then, after <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.173"></a> tying one hundred carts together and yoking Nandivisāla to them, he said: “Go, good ox; pull, good ox." And Nandivisāla pulled those one hundred carts.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>

“One should say what is pleasant,<br>
Never what is unpleasant.<br>
For him of pleasant speech,<br>
Heavy loads got carried,<br>
And he obtained wealth;<br>
And he was delighted with that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.6"></a>“Even at that time, monks, reviling and insulting was unpleasant to me. How then could reviling and insulting be pleasant now? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h2 id="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">6</span>
