At one time the awakened one, the Lord, was staying at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now at that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha ruled with supreme authority over eighty thousand villages. Now at that time, at Campā, a merchant’s son called Soṇa Koḷivisa was delicately nurtured and down came to have grown on the soles of his feet. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having had those eighty thousand village overseers convened, sent a messenger to Soṇa Koḷivisa on some business, saying: "Let Soṇa come, I want Sona to come."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.2" href="#Kd.5.1.2"></a>
Then Soṇa Koḷivisa’s parents spoke thus to Soṇa Koḷivisa: "The king, dear Soṇa, wants to see your feet. Do not you, dear Soṇa, stretch out your feet towards the king; sit down cross-legged in front of the king, and as you are sitting down the king will see your feet." Then they sent Soṇa Koḷivisa away in a palanquin. Then Soṇa Koḷivisa approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having approached, having greeted. King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, he sat down cross-legged in front of the king. So King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha saw the down that was growing on the soles of Soṇa Koḷivisa’s feet.<br>
<br>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, having instructed those eighty thousand village overseers in matters concerning this world, dismissed them, saying: "You, good sirs, are now instructed by me in matters concerning this world; go along, pay homage to this Lord, and our Lord will instruct you in transcendental matters."
</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Then those eighty thousand village overseers approached Mount Vulture Peak.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.4" href="#Kd.5.1.4"></a>
Now at that time the venerable Sāgata was the Lord’s attendant. Then those eighty thousand village overseers
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.237"></a>
 approached the venerable Sāgata; having approached,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.180"></a>
 they spoke thus to the venerable Sāgata: "Honoured sir, these eighty thousand village overseers are approaching here to see the Lord. It were good, honoured sir, if we might have a chance to see the Lord."</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
"Well, then, do you, venerable ones, remain here for a moment until I have let the Lord know."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.5" href="#Kd.5.1.5"></a>
Then the venerable Sāgata, having stepped down from the moonstone (step) in front of the eighty thousand watching village overseers, having stepped up in front of the Lord, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, these eighty thousand village overseers are approaching here to see the Lord. Lord, does the Lord think it is now the right time for this?"<br>
<br>"Well, then, do you, Sāgata, make a seat ready in the shade of the dwelling-place."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.6" href="#Kd.5.1.6"></a>
"Very well, Lord," and the venerable Sāgata having answered the Lord in assent, having taken a chair, having stepped down from in front of the Lord, having stepped up on the moonstone (step) in front of the eighty thousand watching village overseers, made ready a seat in the shade of the dwelling-place. Then the Lord, having issued from the dwelling-place, sat down on the seat made ready in the shade of the dwelling-place.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.7" href="#Kd.5.1.7"></a>
Then those eighty thousand village overseers approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they sat down at a respectful distance. Then those eighty thousand village overseers paid respect only to the venerable Sāgata, not likewise to the Lord.
</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
Then the Lord, knowing by reasoning of mind the minds of those eighty thousand village overseers, addressed the venerable Sāgata, saying: "Well then, do you, Sāgata, abundantly show a state of further-men, a wonder of psychic power."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.238"></a>
"Very well, Lord," and the venerable Sagata, having answered the Lord in assent, having risen above the ground, paced up and down in the air, in the atmosphere, and he stood, and he sat down, and he lay down, and he smoked and he blazed, and then he vanished.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.8" href="#Kd.5.1.8"></a>
Then the venerable Sagata, having shown in the air, in the atmosphere, various states of further-men and wonders of psychic power, having inclined his head towards the Lord’s feet, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, the Lord is my teacher, I am a disciple; Lord, the Lord is my teacher, I am a disciple". Then those eighty thousand village overseers, saying: "Indeed it is marvellous, indeed, it is wonderful, that even a disciple can be of such great psychic power, of such great might. What must the teacher be?" paid respect only to the Lord, not likewise to the venerable Sagata.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.9" href="#Kd.5.1.9"></a>
Then the Lord, knowing by reasoning of mind the minds of those eighty thousand village overseers, talked a progressive talk, that is to say talk on giving, talk on moral habit,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.181"></a>
 talk on heaven, he explained the peril, the vanity, the depravity of pleasures of the senses, the advantage in renouncing (them). When the Lord knew that their minds were ready, malleable, devoid of the hindrances, uplifted, pleased, then he explained to them that teaching on <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> which the awakened ones have themselves discovered: ill, uprising, stopping, the way. And as a clean cloth without black specks will easily take dye, even so as those eighty thousand village overseers were (sitting) on that very seat, <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose: that, "whatever is of the nature to uprise, all that is of the nature to stop."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.10" href="#Kd.5.1.10"></a>
These, having seen <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, attained <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, known <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, plunged into <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, having crossed over doubt, having put away uncertainty, having attained without another’s help to full confidence in the teacher’s instruction, spoke thus to the Lord: "Excellent, Lord, it is excellent, Lord. Just as,
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.239"></a>
 Lord, one should set upright what has been upset or should uncover what is covered or should point out the way to one who is astray or should bring a lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes might see forms, even so is <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> explained in many a figure by the Lord. We, Lord, are those going to the Lord for refuge, to <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and to the Order of monks. May the Lord receive us as lay-followers gone for refuge on this day for as long as life lasts."</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">4</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.11" href="#Kd.5.1.11"></a>
Then it occurred to Soṇa Koḷivisa: "In so far as I understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the Lord it is not easy for those who live in a house to lead the Brahma-faring that is wholly complete, wholly pure, and polished like a conch-shell. What now if I, having cut off hair and beard, having donned yellow robes, should go forth from home into homelessness?" Then those eighty thousand village overseers, delighted with the Lord’s speech, having given thanks for it, having risen from the seat, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping their right sides towards him.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.12" href="#Kd.5.1.12"></a>
Then Soṇa Koḷivisa, soon after those eighty thousand village overseers had departed, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Soṇa Koḷivisa spoke thus to the Lord: "In so far as I, Lord, understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the Lord it is not easy for those who live in a house to lead the Brahma-faring that is wholly complete, wholly pure and polished like a conch-shell. I want, Lord, having cut off hair and beard, having donned yellow robes, to go forth from home into homelessness. Lord, may the Lord let me go forth." So Soṇa Koḷivisa received the going forth in the Lord’s presence, he received ordination. And soon after he was ordained
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.182"></a>
 the venerable Sona stayed in the Cool Grove.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.13" href="#Kd.5.1.13"></a>
Because of his great output of energy in pacing up and down his feet broke, the place for pacing up and down in became stained with blood as though there had been slaughter of cattle. Then as the venerable Soṇa was meditating in private a reasoning arose in his mind thus: "Those who are the Lord’s disciples dwell putting forth energy; I am one of these, yet my mind is not freed from the cankers with no grasping, and moreover there are my family’s possessions. It might be
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.240"></a>
 possible to enjoy the possessions and to do good. Suppose that I, having returned to the low life, should enjoy the possessions and should do good?"<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.14" href="#Kd.5.1.14"></a>
Then the Lord, knowing by mind the venerable Soṇa’s reasoning of mind, as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm, or might bend back his outstretched arm, so did he, vanishing from Mount Vulture Peak, appear in the Cool Grove.
</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Then the Lord, touring the lodgings together with several monks, approached the venerable Soṇa’s place for pacing up and down in. The Lord saw that the venerable Soṇa’s place for pacing up and down in was stained with blood, and seeing (this), he addressed the monks, saying:<br>
<br>"Now why, monks, is this place for pacing up and down in stained with blood as though there has been slaughter of cattle?"<br>
<br>"Lord, because of the venerable Soṇa’s great energy in pacing up and down his feet broke, and this place for pacing up and down in is stained with his blood as though there had been slaughter of cattle."</p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.15" href="#Kd.5.1.15"></a>
Then the Lord approached the venerable Soṇa’s dwelling-place, and having approached he sat down on an appointed seat. And the venerable Soṇa, having greeted the Lord, sat down at a respectful distance. The Lord spoke thus to the venerable Soṇa as he was sitting at a respectful distance:<br>
<br>
"Soṇa, as you were meditating in private did not a reasoning arise in your mind like this: ‘Those who are the Lord’s disciples dwell putting forth energy; I am one of these, yet my mind is not freed from the cankers with no grasping, and moreover there are my family’s possessions. It might be possible to enjoy the possessions and to do good. Suppose that I, having returned to the low life, should enjoy the possessions and should do good?"<br>
<br>"Yes, Lord."<br>
<br>"What do you think about this, Sona? Were you clever at the lute’s stringed music when formerly you were a householder?"<br>
<br>"Yes, Lord."<br>
<br>"What do you think about this, Soṇa? When the strings of your lute were too taut, was your lute at that time tuneful and fit for playing?"<br>
<br>"No, indeed, Lord."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.16" href="#Kd.5.1.16"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.241"></a>
What do you think about this, Soṇa? When the strings of your lute were too slack, was your lute at that time tuneful and fit for playing?"<br>
<br>"No, indeed, Lord."<br>
<br>"What do you think about this, Soṇa? When the strings of your lute were neither too taut nor too slack, but were keyed to an even pitch, was your lute at that time tuneful and fit for playing?"<br>
<br>"Yes, Lord."<br>
<br>
"Even so, Soṇa, does too much output of energy conduce to restlessness, <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.183"></a>
does too feeble energy conduce to slothfulness.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.17" href="#Kd.5.1.17"></a>
"Therefore do you, Soṇa, determine upon evenness in energy and pierce the evenness of the faculties and reflect upon it."<br>
<br>"Yes, Lord," the venerable Soṇa answered the Lord in assent. Then the Lord, having exhorted the venerable Soṇa with this exhortation, as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or might bend back his outstretched arm, so did he, vanishing from in front of the venerable Soṇa in the Cool Grove, appear on Mount Vulture Peak.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">7</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.18" href="#Kd.5.1.18"></a>
After that the venerable Soṇa determined upon evenness in energy and he pierced the evenness of the faculties and reflected upon it. Then the venerable Sona, dwelling alone, aloof, earnest, ardent, self-resolute, having soon realised here and now by his own super-knowledge that supreme goal of the Brahma-faring for the sake of which young men of family rightly go forth from home into homelessness, abided in it, and he understood: Destroyed is birth, lived is the Brahma-faring,
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.242"></a>
 done is what was to be done, there is no more of being such and such. And so the venerable Soṇa became one of the perfected ones.</p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.19" href="#Kd.5.1.19"></a>
When the venerable Soṇa had attained perfection, it occurred to him: "Suppose I were to declare profound knowledge in the Lord’s presence?" Then the venerable Soṇa approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Soṇa spoke thus to the Lord:<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.20" href="#Kd.5.1.20"></a>
"Lord, that monk who is one perfected, who has destroyed the cankers, lived the life, done what was to be done, shed the burden, won his own goal, destroyed utterly the fetter of becoming, and is wholly freed by profound knowledge, he comes to be intent upon six matters: he comes to be intent upon renunciation, he comes to be intent upon aloofness, he comes to be intent upon non-harming, he comes to be intent upon the destruction of grasping, he comes to be intent upon the destruction of craving, he comes to be intent upon non-confusion.</p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.21" href="#Kd.5.1.21"></a>
"Perhaps, Lord, one of the venerable ones here might think: ‘Could it be that this venerable one is intent upon renunciation depending upon mere faith alone?’ But this, Lord, is not to be regarded thus. Lord, the monk who has destroyed the cankers, has lived the life, done what was to be done, not seeing aught in himself to be done or to be added to what has been done, being passionless comes to be intent on renunciation because of the destruction of passion, being without hatred comes to be intent on renunciation because of the destruction of hatred, being without confusion comes to be intent on renunciation because of the destruction of confusion.</p>

<p><span class="parno">10</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.22" href="#Kd.5.1.22"></a>
"Perhaps, Lord, one of the venerable ones here might think: ‘Could it be that this venerable one
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.184"></a>
 is intent on aloofness while hankering after gains, honour, fame?’ But this, Lord, is not to be regarded thus. Lord, the monk who has destroyed the cankers … or to be added to what has been done, being passionless comes to be intent on aloofness because
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.243"></a>

<p><span class="parno">11</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.23" href="#Kd.5.1.23"></a>
"Perhaps, Lord, one of the venerable ones here might think: ‘Could it be that this venerable one is intent on non-harming, is backsliding from the essence to the contagion of habit and custom?’ But this, Lord, is not to be regarded thus. Lord, the monk who has destroyed the cankers … or to be added to what has been done, being passionless comes to be intent on non-harming because of the destruction of passion, being without hatred … being without confusion comes to be intent on non-harming because of the destruction of confusion.</p>

"Thus, Lord, even if shapes cognisable by the eye come very strongly into the field of vision of a monk whose mind is wholly freed, they do not obsess his mind for his mind comes to be undefiled, firm, won to composure, and he notes its

Even so, Lord, if shapes cognisable by the eye come very strongly into the field of vision of a monk whose mind is wholly freed … if mental objects cognisable by the mind come very strongly into the field of thought of a monk whose mind is wholly freed, they do not obsess his mind, for his mind comes to be undefiled, firm, won to composure, and he notes its passing hence."</p>

Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Thus, monks, do young men of family declare profound knowledge. The goal is spoken of but the self is not obtruded. But then it seems to me that there are some foolish men here who declare profound knowledge for fun; these afterwards come to disaster."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.1.29" href="#Kd.5.1.29"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the venerable Sona, saying: "You, Sona, have been delicately nurtured.
<span class="allowance">I allow for you, Sona, sandals with one lining.</span>"<br>
<br>"But I, Lord, gave up eighty cartloads of gold when I went forth from home into homelessness, and a herd of seven elephants.

"If the Lord will allow them to the Order of monks, I too will make use of them, but if the Lord will not allow them to the Order of monks, neither will I make use of them." Then the Lord on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>

"Monks, there should be no inciting (anyone) to onslaught on creatures. Whoever should (so) incite, should be dealt with according to the rule.
<span class="rule">Nor, monks, should a cow-hide be used. Whoever should use one, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>
<span class="rule">Nor, monks, should any hide be used. Whoever should use one, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>"

<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.11.1" href="#Kd.5.11.1"></a>
Now at that time people’s couches and chairs came to be covered up with hides, covered over with hides. Monks being scrupulous, did not sit down on them. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:
"<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to sit down on what is displayed by householders, but not to lie down on it.</span>"<br>
<br>

<p><span class="parno">47</span>Now at that time dwelling-places were lashed together with thongs of hide. Monks, being scrupulous, did not sit down (in them). They told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.260"></a>
"<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to sit down against what is used only for lashing (things together).</span>"<br>

Now at that time the group of six monks entered a village with their sandals on. People looked down upon, criticised spread it about, saying: "Like householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses." They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="rule">Monks, you should not enter a village with your sandals on. Whoever should (so) enter it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="parno">49</span>
Now at that time a certain monk became ill; he was not able to enter the village without his sandals. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, a monk if he is ill to enter a village with his sandals on.</span>"</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">50</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13.1" href="#Kd.5.13.1"></a>
Now at that time the venerable Kaccāna the Great was staying among the people of Avantī at Osprey’s Haunt on Steep Rock mountain slope. Now at that time the lay-follower, Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa, was a supporter of the venerable Kaccāna the Great.
</p>

<p><span class="parno">51</span>Then the lay-follower, Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa, approached the venerable Kaccāna the Great; having
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.261"></a>
 approached, having greeted the venerable Kaccāna the Great, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the lay-follower, Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa, spoke thus to the venerable Kaccāna the Great:<br>
<br>
"In so far as I, honoured sir, understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the master, Kaccāna the Great, it is no easy matter for one living in a house to lead the Brahma-faring which is utterly complete, utterly pure and polished like a conch-shell. I want, honoured sir, having cut off hair and beard, having donned yellow robes, to go forth from home into homelessness. Honoured sir, may the master Kaccāna the Great let me go forth."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13.2" href="#Kd.5.13.2"></a>
He said: "Difficult, Soṇa, for as long as life lasts are the solitary sleeping-place, the one meal (a day), the Brahma-faring. Please do you, Soṇa, being a householder as before, practise the instruction of the awakened ones for a short time: the solitary sleeping-place, the one meal (a day), the Brahma-faring."<br>
<br>
Then that abated which had been the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa’s strong aspiration for the going forth.
<p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">52</span>But a second time did the lay follower Soṇa
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.195"></a>
Kuṭikaṇṇa … But a third time did the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa approach the venerable Kaccāna the Great … <br>
<br>"In so far as I, honoured sir, understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> taught by the master, Kaccāna the Great, it is no easy matter for one living in a house to lead the Brahma-faring which is utterly complete, utterly pure and polished like a conch-shell. I want, honoured sir, having cut off hair and beard, having donned yellow robes, to go forth from home into homelessness. Honoured sir, may the master Kaccāna the Great let me go forth." " … Honoured sir, may the master Kaccāna the Great let me go forth." Then the venerable Kaccāna the Great let the lay-follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa go forth. Now at that time the southern region of Avantī came to be short of monks. Then did the
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.262"></a>
 venerable Kaccāna the Great at the end of three years, with difficulty, with trouble, having had convened from here and there an Order of monks consisting of ten, ordain the venerable Soṇa.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13.3" href="#Kd.5.13.3"></a>
Then as the venerable Soṇa was keeping the rains and meditating in seclusion, a reasoning arose in his mind thus: "I have only heard that this Lord is such and such a one, but I have not seen him face to face. I would go and see this Lord, the perfected, the all-awakened one, if a preceptor would allow me." Then the venerable Soṇa, emerging from seclusion towards the evening, approached the venerable Kaccāna the Great; having approached, having greeted the venerable Kaccāna the Great, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Sona spoke thus to the venerable Kaccāna the Great:</p>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13.4" href="#Kd.5.13.4"></a>
"Now, as I, honoured sir, was meditating in seclusion, a reasoning arose in my mind thus: ‘I have only heard that this Lord is such and such a one, but I have not seen him face to face. I would go to see this Lord, the perfected, the all-awakened one, if a preceptor would allow me.’ I, honoured sir, would go to see this Lord, the perfected, the all-awakened one, if the preceptor allows me."</p>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
"Good, it is good, Soṇa. Do you, Soṇa, go to see this Lord, the perfected, the all-awakened one.</p>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13.5" href="#Kd.5.13.5"></a>
"You, Soṇa, will see this Lord, who is pleasant and inspires one to be pleased, who is calmed in his sense-organs, calmed in mind, who has attained the uttermost taming and peace, the hero tamed, guarded, controlled in his sense-organs. Well then, do you, Soṇa, in my name salute the Lord’s feet with your head, saying: ‘Lord, my preceptor, the venerable Kaccāna the Great, salutes the Lord’s feet with his head’, and then speak thus: ‘Lord, the southern region of Avantī
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.263"></a>
 is short of monks. At the end of three years (he), with difficulty, with trouble, having had convened for me from here and there an Order of monks consisting of ten, I received ordination. Perhaps the Lord would allow ordination by a smaller group in the southern region of Avantī.</p>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13.6" href="#Kd.5.13.6"></a>
"‘Lord, in the southern region of Avantī the surface-soil is dark, hard, trampled by the hooves of cattle. Perhaps the Lord
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.196"></a>
 would allow sandals with many linings in the southern region of Avantī. Lord, in the southern region of Avantī people attach importance to bathing, to purification by water. Perhaps the Lord would allow constant bathing in the southern region of Avantī. Lord, in the southern region of Avantī hides (are used as) coverings: sheep-hide, goat-hide, deer-hide. As, Lord, in the middle districts, <i lang="pi">eragu</i>, <i lang="pi">moragu</i>, <i lang="pi">majjhāru</i>, <i lang="pi">jantu</i> (are used), so, Lord, in the southern region of Avantī hides (are used as) coverings. Perhaps the Lord would allow hides (to be used as) coverings in the southern region of Avantī: sheep-hide, goat-hide, deer-hide.</p>

<p><span class="parno">53</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13.7" href="#Kd.5.13.7"></a>
"‘At present, Lord, people give robe-material to monks who have gone outside the boundaries, saying: "We are giving this robe-material for so and so." When these have come back (the others) announce: "Your reverences, robe-material was given for you by the people so and so". But these, being scrupulous, do not consent to it, thinking: "Let there not be an offence involving forfeiture for us." Perhaps the Lord would explain the procedure in regard to robe-material.’"<br>
<br>
"Yes, honoured sir", and the venerable Sona having spoken in assent to the venerable Kaccāna the Great, rising from his <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.264"></a>
seat, having greeted the venerable Kaccāna the Great, having kept his right side towards him, having packed away his lodging, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sāvatthī.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13.8" href="#Kd.5.13.8"></a>
In due course he approached Sāvatthī, the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance.
<p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">54</span>Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying: "Ānanda, make ready a lodging for this incoming monk". Then the venerable Ānanda thought:<br>
<br>"The Lord desires to stay in the same dwelling-place together with this monk, the Lord desires to stay in the same dwelling-place together with the venerable Soṇa; it is he in regard to whom the Lord enjoined me, saying: ‘Ānanda, make ready a lodging for this incoming monk’," and he made ready a lodging for the venerable Soṇa in that dwelling-place where the Lord was staying.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">55</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13.9" href="#Kd.5.13.9"></a>
Then the Lord, having spent a great part of that night in the open air, entered the dwelling-place. The venerable Soṇa also, having spent a great part of that night in the open air, entered the dwelling-place. Then the Lord, getting up in the night towards dawn, requested the venerable Soṇa, saying:<br>
<br>
"May (some) <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> occur to you to speak, monk."<br>
<br>
"Very well, Lord", and the venerable Soṇa, having replied in assent to the Lord, spoke from memory everything belonging to the Divisions in the Eights. Then the Lord at the end <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.265"></a>
of the venerable Soṇa’s recital expressed his approbation saying:<br>
<br>
"Good, it is good, monk, that by you, monk, the Divisions in the Eights are well learnt, <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.197"></a>
well attended to, well reflected upon, and that you are endowed with lovely speech, distinct, without hoarseness, so as to make the meaning clear. Of how many years’ standing are you, monk?"<br>
<br>"I, Lord, am of one year’s standing."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13.10" href="#Kd.5.13.10"></a>
"But what have you, monk, done thus long?"<br>
<br>"For long, Lord, I have seen peril in pleasures of the senses, but household lives are crowded, there is much to be done, much business." Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this utterance:</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">56</span>
"Having seen peril in the world, <br>
having known <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> without attachment, <br>
the noble one delights not in evil, <br>
the pure one delights in instruction."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="parno">57</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13.11" href="#Kd.5.13.11"></a>
Then the venerable Soṇa, thinking: "The Lord is much pleased with me, this is the time for that for which the preceptor prepared me," rising from his seat, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having inclined his head to the Lord’s feet, spoke thus:<br>
<br>
"Lord, my preceptor, the venerable Kaccāna the Great, salutes the Lord’s feet with his head, and speaks thus: ‘Lord, the southern region of Avantī is short of monks. At the end of three years (he), with difficulty, with trouble, having had convened for me from here and there an Order of monks consisting of ten, I received ordination.

"‘Lord, in the southern region of Avantī the surface-soil is dark, hard, trampled by the hooves of cattle. Perhaps the Lord
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.196." href="#Vin.1.196"></a>
 would allow sandals with many linings in the southern region of Avantī. Lord, in the southern region of Avantī people attach importance to bathing, to purification by water.

Perhaps the Lord would allow hides (to be used as) coverings in the southern region of Avantī: sheep-hide, goat-hide, deer-hide.<br>

<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13..7" href="#Kd.5.13.13"></a>
"‘At present, Lord, people give robe-material to monks who have gone outside the boundaries, saying: "We are giving this robe-material for so and so."

But these, being scrupulous, do not consent to it, thinking: "Let there not be an offence involving forfeiture for us." Perhaps the Lord would explain the procedure in regard to robe-material.’"</p>

<p><span class="parno">58</span>Then the Lord, on this occasion, in this connection, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>
<br>
"Monks, the southern region of Avantī is short of monks. <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.266"></a>
I allow, monks, in all border districts ordination by a group with, as fifth, an expert on discipline.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13.12" href="#Kd.5.13.12"></a>
"For this purpose, these are the border districts: the little town called Kajangala is in the eastern direction, beyond it is Mahāsālā, further than that are border districts, on this side are the middle (districts). The river called Sallavatī is in the south-eastern direction, further than that are border districts, on this side are the middle (districts). The little town called Setakaṇṇika is in the southern direction, further than that are border districts, on this side are the middle (districts). The brahmin village called Thūna is in the western direction, further than that are border districts, on this side are the middle (districts). The mountain slope called Usīraddhaja is in the northern direction, further than that are border districts, on this side are the middle (districts). I allow, monks, in such border districts as these, ordination by a group with, as fifth, an expert on discipline.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.5.13.13" href="#Kd.5.13.13"></a>
"In the southern region of Avantī, monks, the surface-soil is dark, hard, trampled by the hooves of cattle. I allow, monks, in all border districts, sandals with many linings.
