<h2 class="nidana">Origin story</h2>

<p><span class="parno">1</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.199"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Ss.2.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Ss.2.1.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.993"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇdika’s park. At that time Venerable Udāyī was staying in the wilderness. He had a beautiful dwelling, which had a room in the middle, surrounded by a corridor on all sides. The bed and bench were well placed, as were the cushion and pillow, and likewise the water for drinking and that for washing. The veranda was well swept. Many people came to see Venerable Udāyīʼs dwelling.</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.994"></a>Also a certain brahmin and his wife approached Venerable Udāyī and said: "Venerable, we would like to have look at your dwelling."<br>
<br>"Well then, brahmin, have a look."<br>
<br>He took the key, unlatched the bolt, opened the door, and entered the dwelling. The brahmin entered after him and then the brahmin lady. Opening some windows and closing others, Venerable Udāyī walked around the inner room and came up from behind the brahmin lady, touching her with his genitals.<span class="note"> <span class="details"><span class="p"><i>Anga-m-angāni</i>, lit. "various limbs" or "limb by limb." This seems to be a euphemism for the genitals, see <span class="ref">Pj.1.10.17 and 1.10.21</span>.</span></span></span> Then the<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.200"></a> brahmin thanked Venerable Udāyī and departed. He expressed his delight: "These Sakyan ascetics who live in such a wilderness are superb. Venerable Udāyī is superb!"</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.995"></a>But the brahmin lady said: <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.120"></a>"What is superb about him? Just as you touch me with your genitals, so did he."<br>
<br>Then the brahmin complained and criticised him: "These Sakyan ascetics are shameless, immoral, and liars. They claim to be followers of Dhamma, of good morality, committed to the spiritual life, speakers of truth, virtuous, of good conduct. But there is no recluseship or brahminhood among these—it is lost to them. Where is recluseship and brahminhood among them? They have departed from it. How can the ascetic Udāyī touch my wife with his genitals? Itʼs not possible to go to a monastery or a monastic dwelling with wives of respectable families, with daughters, girls, with daughters-in-law, or with female slaves of respectable<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.201"></a> families. If they go, the Sakyan ascetics might molest them."</p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Ss.2.1.2"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.996"></a>The monks heard the criticism of that brahmin. The monks of few desires … complained and criticised Venerable Udāyī: "How can Venerable Udāyī make physical contact with a woman?" <a class="pts_pn" id="MS.997"></a></p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>Then those monks informed the Master. And the Master convened the Sangha and questioned Venerable Udāyī:<br>
<br>"Is it true, Udāyī, that you made physical contact with a woman?"<br>
<br>"Itʼs true, Master."<br>
<br>The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: "Foolish man, itʼs not suitable, itʼs not becoming, itʼs not proper, itʼs not worthy of a recluse, itʼs not allowable, itʼs not to be done. How could you make physical contact with a woman? Have I not taught the Dhamma in many ways for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion … for the stilling of the fever for sense pleasures? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
