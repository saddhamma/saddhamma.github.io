At one time the Awakened One, the Lord, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time incoming monks entered the monastery with their sandals on, and they entered the monastery with sunshades up, and they entered the monastery with their heads muffled up, and they entered the monastery having put their robes on their heads, and they washed their feet in the drinking water, and they did not greet the resident monks who were senior nor ask about lodgings. And a certain incoming monk, having unfastened the bolt of an unoccupied dwelling-place, having opened the door, entered hastily. A snake fell on to his shoulder from a lintel above; terrified, he uttered a cry of distress. Monks, having run up, spoke thus to that monk: "Why did you, your reverence, utter a cry of distress?" Then this monk told this matter to the monks.
</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can these incoming monks enter a monastery with their sandals on … nor ask about lodgings?" Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>
<br>"Is it true, as is said, monks, that incoming monks entered a monastery with their sandals on … and did not ask about lodgings?" <br>
<br>"It is true, Lord." The Awakened One, the Lord, rebuked them, saying:<br>
<br>"How, monks, can incoming monks enter a monastery with their sandals on … nor ask about lodgings? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.292"></a>
"Well then, monks, I will lay down an observance for incoming monks which should be observed by incoming monks.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.18.1.2" href="#Kd.18.1.2"></a>
"Monks, an incoming monk, thinking, ‘I will now enter a monastery,’
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.208"></a>
 having taken off his sandals, having put them down, having beaten them, having taken them up (again), having lowered his sunshade, having uncovered his head, having put his robe over his shoulder, should enter the monastery carefully and unhurriedly. While he is entering the monastery, he should notice where the resident monks have withdrawn to. Wherever resident monks have withdrawn to—whether to an assembly hall or to a hut or to the root of a tree—having gone there, he should put down his bowl at one side, he should put down his robe at one side, and having taken a suitable seat he should sit down. He should ask about the drinking water, he should ask about the washing water—which the drinking water is, which the washing water. If he wants drinking water, having taken drinking water he should drink; if he wants washing water, having taken washing water he should wash his feet. When he is washing his feet he should sprinkle water (over them) with one hand and wash his feet with the other; but he should not sprinkle water and wash his feet with one and the same hand. Having asked for a piece of cloth to wipe his sandals, he should wipe the sandals. While he is wiping his sandals he should first wipe them with a dry piece of cloth, afterwards with a damp one; having washed the pieces of cloth for wiping the sandals he should spread them on one side.

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
 If a resident monk is senior he should greet him; if he is newly ordained he should make him greet (him). He should ask about lodgings, saying: ‘Which lodging pertains to me?’ He should ask whether it is occupied or unoccupied. He should ask about resorts for alms, he should ask about non-resorts for
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.293"></a>
 alms, he should ask about the families which are agreed upon as learners, he should ask about the privies, he should ask about the drinking water, he should ask about the water for washing, he should ask about a staff, he should ask about (the form of) the Order’s agreement, saying: ‘What time should it be entered upon, what time should it be departed from?<br>

"If the dwelling-place is unoccupied, having knocked at the door, having waited a moment, having unfastened the bolt, having opened the door, he should watch out while standing outside.
</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
If the dwelling-place is soiled or if couch is piled on couch or if chair is piled on chair and lodgings heaped on top of them, he should clear (the dwelling-place) if he is able to do so. While clearing the dwelling place, having first taken out the ground covering he should lay it to one side. Having taken out the supports for the beds … having taken out the mattress and the squatting-mat … the piece of cloth to sit upon and the sheet, he should lay them to one side. Having lowered the couch, having taken it out carefully without rubbing it, without knocking it against the door or the posts

 he should lay it to one side. Having lowered the chair, having taken it out carefully without rubbing it, without knocking it against the door or the posts, he should lay it to one side. Having taken out the spittoon, he should lay it to one side. Having taken out the reclining board, he should lay it to one side. If there are cobwebs in the dwelling-place, he should first remove them from the (floor-) covering. He should wipe the corners of the window-holes. If a wall that was coloured red becomes stained, he should wipe it having moistened a rag, having wrung it out. If ground that was blacked becomes stained, he should wipe it having moistened a rag, having wrung it out. If the ground has not been treated, he should sweep it having sprinkled it all over with
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.294"></a>
 water, thinking: ‘Take care lest the dwelling-place is sullied with dust.’ Having looked for (any) rubbish, he should remove it to one side.</p>

<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.18.1.4" href="#Kd.18.1.4"></a>
"Having dried the ground-covering in the sun, having cleaned it, having shaken it, having brought it back, he should lay it down as it was before. Having dried the supports for the couch in the sun, having wiped them, having brought them back, he should place them as they were before. Having dried the couch in the sun … the chair in the sun, having cleaned it, having shaken it, having lowered it, having brought it back carefully without rubbing it, without knocking it against the door or the posts, it should be laid down as it was before. Having dried the mattress and the squatting mat in the sun, having cleaned them, having shaken them, having brought them back, they should be laid down as they were before. Having dried the piece of cloth to sit upon and the sheet in the sun, having cleaned them, having shaken them, having brought them back, they should be laid down as they were before. Having dried the spittoon in the sun, having wiped it, having brought it back, it should be placed where it was before. Having dried the reclining-board in the sun, having wiped it, having brought it back, it should be placed where it was before. <br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.18.1.5" href="#Kd.18.1.5"></a>
"He should lay aside the bowl and robes. When laying aside the bowl, having taken the bowl in one hand, having felt with the other under the couch or under the chair, the bowl should be laid aside, but the bowl should not be laid aside on the bare ground. When laying aside the robe, having taken the robe in one hand, having stroked the other hand along the bamboo for robes or along the cord for robes, having got the edges away from him and the fold towards him, the robe should be laid aside.</p>

"If dusty winds blow from the east, he should close the eastern windows. If dusty winds blow from the west, he should close the western windows. If dusty winds blow from the north, he should close the northern windows. If dusty winds blow from the south, he should close the southern windows. If the weather is cool, he should open the windows <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.295"></a>
by day, he should close them by night. If the weather is warm, he should close the windows by day, he should open them by night.</p>

"If a cell <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.210"></a>
is soiled, the cell should be swept. If a porch is soiled, the porch should be swept. If an attendance-hall … if a fire-hall … if a privy is soiled, the privy should be swept. If there is no drinking water, drinking water should be provided. If there is no water for washing, water for washing should be provided. If there is no water in the pitcher of water for rinsing, water should be tipped into the pitcher of water for rinsing.

Now at that time resident monks, having seen incoming monks, neither appointed a seat nor brought forward water for the feet, a footstool, a footstand, nor, having gone to meet them, did they receive their bowls and robes, they did not offer drinking water, they did not greet the senior incoming monks, nor appoint lodgings. Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can these resident monks, having seen incoming monks, neither appoint a seat … nor appoint lodgings?" Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>
<br>"Is it true, as is said, monks … ?"<br>
<br>"It is true, Lord." Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>An incoming monk should be greeted and a lodging appointed with the words, ‘This lodging pertains

And incoming monks should be made to greet (him). The lodgings should be explained to him with the words, ‘This lodging pertains to you.’ He should explain whether it is occupied or unoccupied, alms resorts should be explained … (the form of) the Order’s agreement should be explained with the words, ‘This is the time to enter upon it, this is the time to depart from it.’ This, monks, is the observance for resident monks that should be observed by resident monks."</p>

Now at that time monks who were going away set out without having packed away their wooden goods and clay goods, having opened the doors and windows, and without having asked (for permission) as to their lodgings. The wooden goods and the clay goods were lost and the lodgings came to be unguarded. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: "How can these monks who are going away set out … lodgings came to be unguarded?" Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:</p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>"Well then, monks, I will lay down an observance for monks who are going away and which should be observed by monks who are going away.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.18.3.2" href="#Kd.18.3.2"></a>
"Monks, when a monk is going away, having packed away his wooden goods, his clay goods, having closed the doors and windows, he may set out having asked (for permission) as to his lodgings. If there is no monk, he should ask a novice
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.297"></a>
 (for permission). If there is no novice, he should ask a monastery attendant (for permission). If there is no monk or novice or monastery attendant, having laid a couch down on four stones, having piled couch on couch, having piled chair on chair, having made the lodgings into a heap on top (of them), he may set out having packed away the wooden goods the clay goods, having closed the doors and windows.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.18.3.3" href="#Kd.18.3.3"></a>
"If the dwelling-place is leaking he should roof it if he is able to do so, or he should make an effort, thinking, ‘How then can this dwelling-place be roofed?’ If he thus succeeds in this, that is good, but if he does not succeed, having laid down a couch on four stones in a place where it is not leaking, having piled couch on couch, having piled chair on chair, having made the lodgings into a heap on top (of them), he may set out, having packed away his wooden goods, his clay goods, having closed the doors and windows. If the whole dwelling-place is leaking, if he is able he should convey the lodgings to a village, or he should make an effort, thinking,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.212"></a>
 ‘How then can this lodging be conveyed to a village?’ If he thus succeeds in this, that is good. If he does not succeed, having laid a couch down on four stones in the open air, having piled couch on couch, having piled chair on chair, having made the lodgings into a heap on top (of them), having packed away his wooden goods, his clay goods, having covered them with grass or leaves, he may set out, thinking, ‘So can the different things surely remain.’ This, monks, is the observance for monks who are going away and which should be observed by monks who are going away."</p>

<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.18.4.1" href="#Kd.18.4.1"></a>
Now at that time monks did not give thanks in a refectory. People looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can these recluses, sons of the Sakyans, not give thanks in a refectory?" Monks heard these people who … spread it about. Then these monks told this matter to the Lord.
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.298"></a>
 Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to give thanks in a refectory.</span>" Then it occurred to the monks: "Now, by whom should thanks be given in a refectory?" They told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to give thanks in a refectory through a monk who is an elder.</span>"<br>
<br>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>Now at that time a certain guild had food for an Order; the venerable Sāriputta was the elder in the Order. Monks, thinking, ‘The Lord has allowed thanks to be given in a refectory through a monk who is an elder,’ departed, leaving the venerable Sāriputta alone. Then the venerable Sāriputta, having returned thanks to these people, later went away alone. The Lord saw the venerable Sāriputta coming in the distance; seeing him, he spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta: "I hope, Sāriputta, that the meal was successful?"<br>
<br>"The meal, Lord, was successful, even though the monks departed leaving me alone." Then the Lord on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>
<br>
"<span class="allowance">I allow, monks, four or five monks who are elders or next (in age) to the elders to wait in a refectory.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>
Now at that time a certain elder waited in a refectory although he wanted to relieve himself, and through restraining himself he fell down fainting. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, if there is a reason, to go away, having asked (permission from) the monk immediately next (to you).</span>"</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">18</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.18.4.2" href="#Kd.18.4.2"></a>
Now at that time the group of six monks, wrongly dressed, wrongly clothed,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.213"></a>
 improperly attired, went into a refectory and turning aside went in close in front of monks who were elders, and sat down encroaching on (the space intended for) the elders and kept newly ordained monks from a seat and
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.299"></a>
 sat down amid the houses having spread out their outer cloaks. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: "How can the group of six monks, wrongly dressed, wrongly clothed, improperly attired, go into a refectory … sit down encroaching on … and sit down amid the houses haying spread out their outer cloaks?" Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>
<br>"Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six monks, wrongly dressed … having spread out their outer cloaks?"<br>
<br>"It is true, Lord." Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

Now at that time monks who walked for almsfood walked for almsfood wrongly dressed, wrongly clothed, improperly attired, and they entered a dwelling without deliberation and they left without deliberation, and they entered very hastily and they left very hastily, and they stood too far away and they stood too close, and they stood too long and they turned away too soon. And a certain monk who was walking for almsfood entered a dwelling without deliberation; taking (a doorway) for the house-door, he entered an inner chamber. In that inner chamber a woman was lying naked on her back. That monk saw that woman lying naked on her back; seeing her, he thought: "This is not the house-door, this is an inner chamber," and he went away from that inner chamber. That woman’s husband saw that woman lying naked on her back: seeing her, he thought: "My wife has been seduced by that monk," and having seized that monk, he thrashed him. Then that woman, waking up at the noise, spoke thus <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.302"></a>
to that man: "Why are you, master, thrashing this monk?" <br>
<br>"You were seduced by this monk."<br>
<br>"I was not, master, seduced by this monk. This monk is innocent," and she made him let go of that monk. Then that monk, having gone back to the monastery, told this matter to the monks.
</p>

<p><span class="parno">29</span>Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can these monks who walk for almsfood walk for almsfood wrongly dressed … enter … depart … stand … and turn away too soon?" Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said: "Is it true, as is said, monks … ?"<br>
<br>"It is true, Lord." Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p><span class="parno">30</span>"Well then, monks, I will lay down an observance for monks when they are walking for almsfood and which should be observed by monks when they are walking for almsfood.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.18.5.2" href="#Kd.18.5.2"></a>
"Monks, if a monk when he is walking for almsfood thinks: ‘I will enter this village,’ having dressed himself with his inner robe all round him so as to cover the three circles, having fastened his waistband, having made one bundle, having clothed himself in his upper robes, having fastened the block, having washed, having taken a bowl, he may enter the village carefully and unhurriedly.</p>

<p><span class="parno">32</span>When he is going amid the houses he should consider: ‘I will enter in this (fashion), I will leave in this.’ He should not enter too hastily, he should not leave too hastily, he should not stand too far away, he should not stand too close, he should not stand too long, he should not turn away too soon. While he is standing, he should consider: ‘Are they willing to give alms or are they not willing?’ If she puts aside her work or rises from her seat or wipes a spoon or wipes a dish or sets it out, he should stand still, thinking: ‘It is as though she is willing to give.’ When alms are being given, having raised the outer cloak with the left hand, having uncovered the bowl with the right hand, having grasped the bowl with both hands, the alms should be received, but one should not look at the face of the donor of the alms. He should consider: ‘Are they willing to give curry or are they not willing?’ If she wipes a spoon or wipes a dish or sets it out, he should stand still, thinking: ‘It is as though she is willing to give’. When the alms have been given, having covered the bowl with the outer cloak, one should turn away carefully and unhurriedly.

"Whoever returns first from the village for almsfood should make ready a seat, he should bring forward water for (washing) the feet, a footstool, a footstand, he should set out a refuse bowl, having washed it, he should set out drinking water and water for washing. Whoever should return last from the village for almsfood, if there should be the remains of a meal and if he should so desire, he may eat them; but if he should not so desire, he may throw them away where there is but little green grass or he may drop them into water where there are no living creatures. He should put up the seat, he should put away the water for (washing) the feet, the footstool, the footstand, he should put away the refuse-bowl, having washed it, he should put away the drinking water and the water for washing, he should sweep the refectory. Whoever should see a vessel for drinking water or a vessel for washing water or a vessel (for water) for rinsing after evacuation, void and empty, should set out (water). If it is impossible for him (to do this) he should set out (water) by signalling with his hand, having invited a companion (to help him) by a movement of his hand; but he should not for such a reason break into speech. This, monks, is the observance for monks when they are walking for almsfood and which should be observed by monks when they are walking for almsfood."</p>

Now at that time several monks were living in a forest.
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.5.304"></a>
 They neither set out drinking water, nor did they set out water for washing,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.2.217"></a>
 nor did they set out a fire, nor did they set out kindling wood, they did not know the positions of the lunar mansions, they did not know the divisions of the quarters. Thieves, having gone there, spoke thus to these monks: "Is there drinking water, honoured sirs?" <br>
<br>"There is not, friends."<br>
<br>"Is there water for washing … Is there a fire … Is there kindling wood, honoured sirs?"<br>
<br>"There is not, friends."<br>
<br>"What is there a conjunction with to-day, honoured sirs?" <br>
<br>"Indeed, we do not know, friends." <br>
<br>"Which quarter is this, honoured sirs?" <br>
<br>"Indeed, we do not know, friends." Then these thieves thought: ‘These have no drinking water nor water for washing, there is no fire, there is no kindling wood, they do not know the positions of the lunar mansions, they do not know the divisions of the quarters. These are thieves, these are not monks,’ and having thrashed them, they departed. Then these monks told this matter to the monks. The monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:</p>

"Monks, a monk who is a forest-dweller, getting up early, having placed his bowl in a bag, having hung it on his shoulder, having arranged his robe over his shoulder, having put on his sandals, having packed away the wooden goods, the clay goods, having closed the doors and windows, may leave his lodgings. If he thinks: ‘Now I will enter a village,’ having taken off his sandals, having put them down, having beaten them, having placed them in a bag, having hung it on his shoulder, having dressed himself all round covering the three circles, having fastened his waistband, having dressed himself with his inner robe all round him so as to cover the three circles, having fastened his waistband, having made one bundle, having clothed himself in his upper robes, having fastened the block, having washed, having taken a bowl, he may enter the village carefully and unhurriedly.

<p><span class="parno">36</span>He should go amid the houses properly clad … he should not go amid the houses crouching down on his heels.

Now at that time teachers did not conduct themselves properly towards their pupils. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: "How can these teachers not conduct themselves properly towards pupils?" Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said: "Is it true, as is said, monks, that teachers do not conduct themselves properly towards pupils?"<br>
<br>"It is true, Lord." Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:
</p>

<p><span class="parno">102</span>"Well then, monks, I will lay down an observance for teachers towards pupils and which should be observed by teachers towards pupils.<br>

If a robe is damp with perspiration, he should dry it for a short time in the sun’s warmth, but a robe should not be laid aside in the warmth. He should fold up the robe. When folding up the robe, having made the corners turn back four finger-breadths, he should fold up the robe, thinking: ‘Mind there is no crease in the middle’. The waistband should be placed in a fold (of the robe).
