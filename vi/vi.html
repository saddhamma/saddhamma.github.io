<h2>Vinaya Pitaka - Monastic Rules</h2>

<p><i>These pages only contain a selection of the more important vinaya texts, specifically, those texts that are more reliably the "Word of the Buddha" thus the later commentarial material has been omitted.</i></p>

<p class="namo">
Homage to the Master, the <i lang="pi">Arahant</i>, the truly Awakened One</p>
<h2>The Origin of the Vinaya</h2>

<p><span class="pts-pn">BD.1.1, Bu-Pj.1.1.1, Vin.3.1, MS.2 </span>
At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Verañjā near Naḷeruʼs Nimba tree with a great Sangha of five hundred monks. Now a brahmin of Verañjā was told:</p>
<section class="sutta">

<p>"Sir, the recluse Gotama, the Sakyan, having gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is staying at Verañjā near Naleruʼs Nimba tree with a great Sangha of five hundred monks. That Master Gotama has acquired a good reputaton, thus:</p>

<p>ʻHe is indeed a Master, an
<i lang="pi">arahant</i>, fully awakened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the worlds, unrivalled trainer of tamable people, teacher of gods and humans, the Awakened
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.2"></a>
 One, the Master. Having realised with his own direct knowledge this world with its gods, its lords of death and its supreme beings, this population with its recluses and brahmins, its gods and humans, he makes it known to others. He teaches a <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> that is good in the beginning, good in the middle and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.ʼ Good indeed it is to see such <i lang="pi">arahants</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pts-pn">Bu-Pj.1.1.2, MS.3 </span>
Then the brahmin of Verañjā approached the Master, exchanged friendly greetings with him and sat down
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.2"></a>
 to one side. He then said this to the Master:</p>

<p>"I have heard, good Gotama, that the recluse Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are worn, old, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor that he stands up for them or offers them a seat. This is indeed so, for the good Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are worn, old, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat. This, good Gotama, is not proper."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.4"></a>
"Brahmin, in the world with its gods, its lords of death and its supreme beings, in this population with its recluses and brahmins, its gods and humans, I do not see one to whom I should pay homage, for whom I should rise up or to whom I should offer a seat. For if the Tathāgata
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.3"></a>
 should pay homage to anyone, rise up for him or offer him a seat, his head might even split asunder."</p>

<p><span class="pts_pn">Bu-Pj.1.1.3, MS.5 </span>
"The revered Gotama lacks taste."</p>

<p>"There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama lacks taste.ʼ For tastes for forms, sounds, scents, flavours, and tangible objects—these have been destroyed by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that they are incapable of future arising. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama lacks taste.ʼ But that is not what you meant."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.6"></a>
"The revered Gotama is without enjoyment."</p>

<p>
"There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is without enjoyment.ʼ For enjoyments of forms, sounds, scents, flavours, and tangible objects—these have been destroyed by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that they are incapable of future arising. <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.4"></a>
This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is without enjoyment.ʼ But that is not what you meant."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.7"></a>
"The revered Gotama professes the doctrine of non-action."</p>

<p>"There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama professes the doctrine of non-action.ʼ For I teach the non-doing of misconduct by body, speech and mind. I teach the non-doing of manifold bad unwholesome actions. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama professes the doctrine of non-action.ʼ But that is not what you meant."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.8"></a>
"The revered Gotama professes the doctrine of annihilation."</p>

<p>
"There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama professes the doctrine of annihilation.ʼ For I speak of the annihilation of sense desire, anger and confusion; I speak of the annihilation of manifold bad unwholesome qualities. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama professes the doctrine of annihilation.ʼ <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.3"></a>
But that is not what you meant."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.9"></a>
"The revered Gotama is one who detests."</p>

<p>
"There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is one who detests.ʼ For I detest misconduct by <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.5"></a>
body, speech and mind, and the acquisition of manifold bad unwholesome qualities. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is one who detests.ʼ But that is not what you meant."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.10"></a>
"The revered Gotama is a disciplinarian."</p>

<p>
"There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is a disciplinarian.ʼ For I teach the <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> for the disciplining of sense desire, anger and confusion; I teach the <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> for the disciplining of manifold bad unwholesome qualities. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is a disciplinarian.ʼ But that is not what you meant."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.11"></a>
"The revered Gotama is one who practises austerities."</p>

<p>
"There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is one who practises austerities.ʼ For I say that bad unwholesome qualities—misconduct by body, speech and mind—are to be burned up. He who has destroyed the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up, who has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm-stump, done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of future arising—him I call one who practises austerities. The Tathāgata has destroyed the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up, <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.6"></a>
has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm tree, done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of future arising. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is one who practises austerities.ʼ But that is not what you meant."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.12"></a>
"The revered Gotama is withdrawn."</p>

<p>"There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is withdrawn.ʼ He whose future conception in a womb, whose rebirth in a future life, is destroyed and cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that it is incapable of future arising—him I call one who is withdrawn. The Tathāgataʼs future conception in a womb, his rebirth in a future life, is destroyed and cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that he is incapable of future arising. This is a way in which one could truly say of me, ʻthe recluse Gotama is withdrawn.ʼ But that is not what you meant."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.4"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.13"></a>
"Brahmin, suppose there was a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs, which she had properly covered, properly warmed and properly incubated. Is the first chick that hatches safely— having pierced through the egg-shell with the point of the claw on its foot, or with its beak—to be called the eldest or the youngest?"</p>

<p>"He is to be called the eldest, good Gotama, for he is the eldest of those."</p>

<p>
"Even so, brahmin, in this generation without understanding, being like an egg,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.4"></a>
covered over, I
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.7"></a>
 alone in the world have split the eggshell of ignorance and reached the unsurpassed full awakening. I, brahmin, am the worldʼs eldest and best.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.5"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.14"></a>
Brahmin, I was firmly energetic and had clarity of mindfulness; my body was tranquil and my mind unified. Fully secluded from the five senses, secluded from unwholesome mental qualities, I entered and remained in the first <i lang="pi">jhāna</i>, which consists of rapture and happiness born of seclusion, accompanied by movement of the mind. Through the stilling of the movement of the mind, I entered and remained in the second <i lang="pi">jhāna</i>, which has internal confidence and unification of mind and consists of rapture and happiness born of <i lang="pi">samādhi</i>. Through the fading away of rapture, I remained even-minded, mindful and clearly comprehending, experiencing happiness directly, and I entered and remained in the third <i lang="pi">jhāna</i> of which the noble one declare, ʻhe is even-minded, mindful, and abides in happiness.ʼ Through the abandoning of happiness and suffering and the earlier ending of joy and displeasure, I entered and remained in the fourth <i lang="pi">jhāna</i>, which has neither suffering nor happiness and consists of purity of mindfulness and even-mindedness.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.6"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.15"></a>
Then with the mind collected, clarified, purified, flawless, void of taints, grown soft and pliable, steady and
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.8"></a>
 imperturbable, I directed it to the knowledge of the memory of former lives. I recollected many past lives, that is to say, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, and many eons of world dissolution, many eons of world evolution, and many eons of both dissolution and evolution: "There I had such a name, such a family, such appearance, such food, such experience of happiness and suffering, and such a life-span. Passing away from there I was reborn elsewhere, and there I had such a name … and such a life-span. Passing away from there I was reborn here. Thus I recollected many past lives with their characteristics and particulars." This was the first knowledge attained by me in the first watch of that night; ignorance was dispelled, understanding arose, darkness was dispelled, light arose, as it is for one who remains heedful, ardent and energetic. This, brahmin, was my first
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.9"></a>
 successful breaking forth like a chickʼs from the eggshell.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.7"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.16"></a>
Then with the mind collected, clarified, purified, flawless, void of taints, grown soft and pliable, steady and imperturbable, I directed it to the knowledge of the arising and passing away of beings.
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.5"></a>
 With the purified divine eye surpassing that of humans, I saw beings passing away and getting reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, gone to good destinations and bad destinations, and I understood how beings fare according to their kamma: ʻThese beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech and mind, who abused the noble ones, held wrong view and acted accordingly, at the breaking up of the body after death, have arisen in the plane of misery, a bad destination, the abyss, hell. But these beings who engaged in good conduct of body, speech and mind, who did not abuse the noble ones, held right view and acted accordingly, at the breaking up of the body after death, have arisen in a good destination, a heaven world. Thus with the purified divine eye surpassing that of humans, I saw beings passing away and getting reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, gone to good destinations and bad destinations, and I understood how beings fare according to their kamma. This was the second knowledge attained by me in the middle watch of that night. Ignorance was dispelled, understanding arose, darkness was dispelled, light arose, as it is for one who remains heedful, ardent and energetic. This, brahmin, was my second successful breaking forth, like a chickʼs from the eggshell.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.8"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.17"></a>
Then with the mind collected, clarified, purified,
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.10"></a>
 flawless, void of taints, grown soft and pliable, steady and imperturbable, I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the corruptions. I knew according to reality: This is suffering, this is the arising of suffering, this is the ending of suffering, this is the course leading to the ending of suffering. I knew according to reality: These are the corruptions, this is the arising of the corruptions, this is the ending of the corruptions, this is the course leading to the ending of the corruptions. When I knew and saw this, my mind was freed from the corruption of sense desire, my mind was freed from the corruption of existence, my mind was freed from the corruption of false views, my mind was freed from the corruption of ignorance. When it was freed, I knew, "It is freed," and I understood that birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, the job has been done, there is no further state of existence. This was the third knowledge attained by me in the third watch of that night. Ignorance was dispelled, understanding arose, darkness was dispelled, light arose, as it is for one who remains heedful, ardent and energetic. This, brahmin, was
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.6"></a>
 my third successful breaking forth, like a chickʼs from the eggshell."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.1.1.9"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.18"></a>
When this had been said, the brahmin of Verañjā said to the Master:</p>

<p>
"Good Gotama is the eldest; good Gotama is the best. Wonderful, good Gotama, wonderful. As one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what had been hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes might see forms—even so has the good <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.11"></a>
Gotama made the <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> clear in many ways. To good Gotama I go for refuge, and to the <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> and to the Sangha of monks. May the good Gotama accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life. May the good Gotama consent to spend the rains at Verañjā together with the Sangha of monks." The Master consented by silence. Then the brahmin of Verañjā, understanding that the Master had consented, rose from his seat, paid homage to him and departed, keeping his right side towards him.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.1.2"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.1.2.1"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.19"></a>
At that time Verañjā was short of food and stricken by hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw. It was not easy to keep oneself going by collecting alms. Just then some horse-dealers from Uttarāpathaka entered
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.12"></a>
 the rains residence at Verañjā with five hundred horses. In the horse-pen they prepared <i lang="pi">pattha</i> measure after <i lang="pi">pattha</i> measure of steamed grain  for the monks. The monks, having dressed in the morning, took their bowls and robes and entered Verañjā for alms. Being unable to obtain anything, they went to the horse-pen. Having brought the <i lang="pi">pattha</i> measures of steamed grain back to the monastery, they pounded them and ate them. Venerable Ānanda, having crushed a <i lang="pi">pattha</i> measure of the steamed grain on a stone, took it to the Master, and the Master ate it.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.20"></a>
Now the Master had heard the sound of the mortar. Tathāgatas sometimes ask knowing, and knowing sometimes do not ask; they ask knowing the right time to ask, and they ask knowing the right time when not to ask. Tathāgatas
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.13"></a>
 ask when it is beneficial, not when it is unbeneficial; in regard to what is unbeneficial, the Tathāgatas have destroyed the bridge. The Buddhas, the Masters, question the monks for two reasons: "We shall teach the <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> or lay down a training rule for the disciples."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.21"></a>
Then the Master addressed Venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, what is this sound of a mortar?"</p>

<p>
Then Venerable Ānanda informed the Master. <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.7"></a>
</p>

<p>
"Good, good, Ānanda, you who are superior people have conquered <span class="add">the problems of famine</span>; later generations will despise even rice and meat."</p>

<p><span class="pts_pn">Bu-Pj.1.2.2, MS.22 </span>
Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached the Master, paid homage to him and sat down to one side. He then said to him:</p>

<p>
"At present, Master, Verañjā is short of food <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.14"></a>
and stricken by hunger, with crops blighted and turned to straw. It is not easy to keep oneself going by collecting alms. Master, the under-surface of this great earth is abounding with food, and its taste is just like pure honey. It would be good, Master, if I inverted the earth, so that the monks might enjoy the nutritive essence of the water-plants."</p>

<p>"But what will you do with those creatures, Moggallāna, who are supported by the earth?"</p>

<p>"Master, I will make one of my hands broad, like the great earth, and I will make those creatures who are supported by the earth go there. Then with the other hand I will invert the earth."</p>

<p>"Enough, Moggallāna, please do not invert the earth, or beings may become deranged."</p>

<p>"It would be good, Master, if the whole Sangha of monks could go to Uttarakuru for alms."</p>

<p>"Enough, Moggallāna, do not pursue this idea."</p>

<p><span class="pts_pn">Bu-Pj.1.3, Bu-Pj.1.3.1, MS.23 </span>
Now while Venerable Sāriputta was in seclusion, he thought this: "For which Buddhas, for which Masters, did the spiritual life not last long? For which Buddhas, for which Masters, did the spiritual life last long?"</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.24"></a>
Then, in the evening, Venerable Sāriputta came out of seclusion and approached the Master. He paid homage to him, sat down to one side and said this:
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.15"></a>
 "Just now, Master, as I was in seclusion, I thought this: ʻFor which Buddhas … last long?ʼ"</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.25"></a>
"Sāriputta, the spiritual life established by Master Vipassī, Master Sikhī and Master Vesabhū did not last long. But the spiritual life established by Master Kakusandha, Master Konāgamana and Master Kassapa did last long."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.1.3.2"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.26"></a>
"And what, Master, is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Vipassī, Master Sikhī and Master Vesabhū did not last long?"</p>

<p>
"Sāriputta, Master Vipassī, Master Sikhī and Master Vessabhū were disinclined to teach the
<i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> in detail to their disciples. They had few discourses in prose and in prose and verse, few expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts and analyses; and training rules were not laid down and a <i lang="pi">pātimokkha</i> was not recited. After the disappearance of those Buddhas, those Masters, after the disappearance of the disciples enlightened under those Buddhas, those who were the last disciples—of various
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.16"></a>
 names, clans, and social strata, who had gone forth from various families—caused that spiritual life rapidly to disappear. It is just like various flowers, lying on a flat piece of wood without being tied together by a thread, are scattered about, whirled about and destroyed by the wind. Why is that? Because they are not held together by a thread. Even so, at the disappearance of those Buddhas, those Masters, at the disappearance of the disciples enlightened under those Buddhas, those who were the last disciples—of various names, clans and social strata, who had gone forth from various families—caused that spiritual life rapidly to disappear.
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.27"></a>
 Instead those Masters were untiring in exhorting their disciples, after reading their minds with their own.</p>

<p>
Formerly, Sāriputta, while staying in a certain frightening jungle thicket, Master Vessabhū, the
<i lang="pi">arahant</i>, the fully Awakened One, exhorted and admonished a Sangha of a thousand monks, reading their minds with his own, saying: ʻThink like this, not like this; pay attention like this, not like this; forsake this; having attained this, abide in it.ʼ Then, when those thousand monks had been exhorted and admonished by Master Vessabhū, the <i lang="pi">arahant</i>, the fully Awakened One, their minds were freed from the corruptions without grasping. But if anyone not devoid of desire should enter that frightening jungle-
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.17"></a>
 thicket, usually their hair would stand on end. This is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Vipassī, Master Sikhī and Master Vesabhū did not last long."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.1.3.3"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.28"></a>
"But what, Master, is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Kakusandha, Master Konāgamana and Master Kassapa lasted long?"</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.9"></a>
"Sāriputta, Master Kakusandha, Master Konāgamana and Master Kassapa were diligent in teaching the <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> in detail to their disciples. They had many discourses in prose and in prose and in verse, many expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts and analyses; and training rules for their disciples were laid down and a <i lang="pi">pātimokkha</i> was recited. At the disappearance of those Buddhas, those Masters, at the disappearance of the disciples who were enlightened under those Buddhas, those who were the last disciples—of various names, clans and social strata, who had gone forth from various families—established that spiritual life for a long time. It is just like various flowers, lying on a piece of wood but being well tied together by a thread, are not scattered about, whirled about or destroyed by the wind. Why is that? Because they are well tied together by the thread. Even so, at the disappearance of those Buddhas, those Masters, at the disappearance of the disciples who were enlightened under those Buddhas, those who were the last disciples—of various names, clans and social strata, who had gone forth from various families—established that spiritual life for a long time. This is the reason why the spiritual life established by Master Kakusandha, Master Konāgamana and Master Kassapa lasted long."</p>

<p><span class="pts_pn">Bu-Pj.1.3.4, MS.29 </span>
Then Venerable Sāriputta got up from his seat, put his robe over one shoulder,
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.18"></a>
 put the palms of his hands together and said to the Master:</p>

<p>
"This is the right time, Master, to lay down training rules and recite a <i lang="pi">pātimokkha</i>, so that this spiritual life may persist and last for a long time."</p>

<p>
"Hold on, Sāriputta, the Tathāgata will know the right time for that. The teacher does not lay down training rules for his disciples and recite a
<i lang="pi">pātimokkha</i> until the causes of corruption appear in the Sangha. And they do not appear until the Sangha has attained long standing,
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.19"></a>
 great size or great learning. But when this happens, then the Teacher lays down training rules for his disciples
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.10"></a>
 and recites a <i lang="pi">pātimokkha</i> in order to ward off those causes of corruptions. Sāriputta, the Sangha of monks is devoid of immorality, devoid of danger, stainless, purified, established in the essence. The most backward of these five hundred monks is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in any state of misery, assured, bound for awakening.</p>


<p><span class="pts_pn">BD.1.20, Bu-Pj.1.4, MS.35 </span>
Then the Master addressed Venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, it is the custom for Tathāgatas not to tour the country without having taken leave of those who invited them to spend the rains. Let us go to the brahmin of Verañjā and take leave."</p>

<p>"Yes, Master."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.36"></a>
Then the Master dressed, took his bowl and robe and, with Venerable Ānanda as his attendant, went to the dwelling of the brahmin of Verañjā and sat down on the prepared seat. Then the brahmin of Verañjā approached the Master, paid homage to him and sat down to one side. The Master then said to the brahmin of Verañjā:</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.11"></a>
"Brahmin, having stayed for the rainy season according to your invitation, we are taking leave of you. We wish to depart for a tour of the country."</p>

<p>"It is true, good Gotama, that you have stayed for the rainy season according to my invitation, but a gift has not been given. That is not good, nor is it because we did not want to give. It happened because household life is busy and there is much to do. May the good Gotama consent to a meal tomorrow together with the Sangha of monks."</p>

<p>
The Master consented by keeping silence. Then the Master, having taught, roused, gladdened and delighted the brahmin of Verañjā with a talk on the
<i lang="pi">Dhamma</i>, rose from his seat and went away.
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.37"></a>
 Then, when the night was over, the brahmin of Verañjā prepared various kinds of delicious food in his own home, and then informed the Master:</p>

<p>"It is time, good Gotama, the meal is ready."</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.38"></a>
Then the Master, having dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, he went to the dwelling of the brahmin of Verañjā and
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.21"></a>
 sat down on the prepared seat. Then, with his own hands, the brahmin of Verañjā served various kinds of delicious food to the Sangha of monks with the Buddha at its head. When they were satisfied and the Master had eaten and finished his meal, he gave the Master a set of three robes and a pair of robes to each monk. The Master instructed, roused, gladdened and delighted the brahmin of Verañjā with talk on the <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i>, and then rose from his seat and departed.</p>

<p><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.39"></a>
The Master, having remained at Verañjā for as long as he liked, went to Payāgapatiṭṭhāna via Soreyya, Sankassa and Kaṇṇakujja. There he crossed the river Ganges and proceeded to Benares. Having remained at Benares for as long as he liked, he set out for Vesālī on tour. Wandering on tour by stages, he arrived at Vesālī. There he stayed in the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.</p>

The chapter on Verañjā is finished.</p>
