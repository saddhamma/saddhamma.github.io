<h2>Bhikkhu Vibhanga - Pācittiya 1: The Training Rule on Lying.</h2>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
Venerables, these ninety-two rules entailing confession come up for recitation.</p>
<p class="namo"><span class="parno">2</span>
Homage to the Master, the <i lang="pi">Arahant</i>, the fully Awakened One</p>

<h2 id="nidana">Origin story</h2>

<p><span class="parno">3. Bu-Pc.1.1</span>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Hatthaka the Sakyan was beaten in debate. While talking with members of other sects, he would assert something after denying it, and he would deny something after asserting it. He evaded the issues, deliberately lied, and after reaching an agreement he would speak deceptively. The members of other sects complained and criticised him: <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.165"></a> “How can Hatthaka, while talking with us, assert things after denying them, deny things after asserting them, evade the issues, deliberately lie, and after reaching an agreement speak deceptively?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>
Monks heard the complaints of those members of other sects, and they went to Hatthaka and said: “Is it true, Hatthaka, that while talking with members of other sects, you assert things after denying them, deny things after asserting them, evade the issues, deliberately lie, and after reaching an agreement speak deceptively?"<br>

<br>“These members of other sects should be beaten by any means; they should not be allowed to win."<br>

<br>The monks of few desires … complained and criticised him: “How can Hatthaka, while talking with members of other sects, assert things after denying them, <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.2"></a> deny things after asserting them, evade the issues, deliberately lie, and after reaching an agreement speak deceptively?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
After criticising Hatthaka in many ways, they informed the Master. The Master then convened the Sangha and questioned Hatthaka: “Is it true, Hatthaka, that while talking with members of other sects, you assert things after denying them, deny things after asserting them, evade the issues, deliberately lie, and after reaching an agreement speak deceptively?"<br>

<br>“It’s true, Master."<br>

<br>The Buddha, the Master, criticised him: “ … Foolish man, how can you act in this way? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h2 id="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">6</span><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.166"></a>“If a monk deliberately lies, he commits an offence entailing confession."</p>

<h2 id="pada">Definitions</h2>

<p><span class="parno">7. Bu-Pc.1.2, Bu-Pc.1.2.1</span>Deliberately lies: the speech of one who is intent on deceiving—his words, his way of speaking, his breaking into speech, his verbal expression, his eight kinds of ignoble speech: he says that he has seen what he has not seen; he says that he has heard what he has not heard; he says that he has sensed what he has not sensed; he says that he has cognised what he has not cognised; he says that he has not seen what he has seen; he says that he has not heard what he has <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.167"></a> heard; he says that he has not sensed what he has sensed; he says that he has not cognised what he has cognised.</p>

<h2 id="cakka">Permutations</h2>

<h4 id="anupada">Definitions</h4>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
Not seen: not seen with the eye. Not heard: not heard with the ear. Not sensed: not smelled with the nose, not tasted with the tongue, not touched with the body. Not cognised: not cognised with the mind. Seen: seen with the eye. Heard: heard with the ear. Sensed: smelled with the nose, tasted with the tongue, touched with the body. Cognised: cognised with the mind.
