At that time the awakened one, the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time as many as thirty monks of Pāvā, all forest-dwellers, all almsmen, all wearers of rag-robes, all wearers of the three robes, going to Sāvatthī so as to see the Lord when the beginning of the rains was approaching, were unable to reach Sāvatthī for the beginning of the rains; they entered upon the rains on the way, at Sāketa. They spent the rains in a state of longing, thinking: "The Lord is staying close to us, six <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> from here, but we are not getting a chance to see the Lord."
<br>
<br>
Then these monks having, after the lapse of three months, kept the rains, after the Invitation had been carried out, while the god was raining, while waters were gathering, while swamps <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.352"></a>
were forming, with drenched robes and in a state of weariness approached Sāvatthī, the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they sat down at a respectful distance.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.7.1.2" href="#Kd.7.1.2"></a>
Now it is the custom for awakened ones, for Lords to exchange friendly greetings with in-coming monks.
</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
So the Lord spoke thus to these monks:<br>
<br>"I hope, monks, that things went well with you, I hope you had enough to support life, I hope that, in unity, being on friendly terms and harmonious, you spent a comfortable rainy season and did not go short of almsfood?"<br>
<br>
"Things did go well with us, Lord, we had enough to support life, Lord, and in unity we, Lord, being on friendly terms and harmonious, spent the rainy season and did not go short of almsfood. Here are we, Lord, as many as thirty monks of Pāvā, coming to Sāvatthī so as to see the Lord, (but) when the beginning of the rains was approaching, we were unable to reach Sāvatthī for the beginning of the rains; we entered on the rains on the way, at Sāketa. We spent the rains, Lord, in a state of longing for you, <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.254"></a>
thinking: ‘The Lord is staying close to us, six <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> from here, but we are not getting a chance to see the Lord.’ Then we, Lord, having, after the lapse of three months, kept the rains, and after the Invitation had been carried out, while the god was raining, while waters were gathering, while swamps were forming, with drenched robes and in a state of weariness came along on the journey."</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.7.1.3" href="#Kd.7.1.3"></a>
Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given <i lang="pi">dhamma-talk</i> addressed the monks, saying:<br>
<br>
"<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to make up
<i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth when monks have completed the rains. Five (things) will be allowable to you, monks, when the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloths have been made up: going
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.353"></a>
 (to families for alms) without having asked for permission, walking (for alms) not taking the three robes, a group-meal, as many robes as you require, and whatever robe-material accrues there, that will be for them. These five (things) will be allowable to you, monks, when the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloths have been made.</span> And thus, monks, should <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth be made:<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.7.1.4" href="#Kd.7.1.4"></a>
"The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent monk, saying:

And even if <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth comes to be quite properly made, but if no one gives thanks for it standing outside the boundary, thus also <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth comes to be not made.

A monk, after <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth has been made, goes away, travelling to distant parts without collecting his share of the robe-material … <br>

with drenched (robes) to see the Conqueror.
</p>

<p><span class="parno">142</span>This item of <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth, and the five things called allowable:<br>
Without asking permission, nor taking three robes, <br>
a joint-meal likewise,

<p><span class="parno">147</span><i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i>-cloth comes to be not made, <br>

Unsoiled, when what is allowable (is unsoiled), <br>
pieces of cloth, rags, and bits near a shop,

<p><span class="parno">148</span>
Not insinuation, nor roundabout talking, <br>
