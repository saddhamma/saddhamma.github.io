<h2 id="nidana">Origin story</h2>

<h3 id="anunidana1">First sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.32.1"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.306"></a>At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Rājagaha in the squirrel sanctuary in the Bamboo Grove. At that time, because of decline in support and loss of respect, Devadatta and his followers were only invited to meals after repeatedly asking. People grumbled and complained: “How can the Sakyan ascetics eat at invitations after repeatedly asking? Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t delight in tasty food?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Monks heard those people grumbling and complaining, and the monks of few desires … complained and criticised those monks: “How can Devadatta and his followers eat at invitations after repeatedly asking?" … “Is it true, Devadatta, that you do this?" “It’s true, Master." The Buddha, the Master, criticised them: “ … Foolish man, how can you and your followers eat at invitations after repeatedly asking? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3 id="anupannatti1">Preliminary ruling</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">3</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.307"></a>“If a monk eats in a group, he commits an offence entailing confession."</p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">4</span>
In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>

<h3 id="anunidana2">Second sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.72"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.32.2"></a>Soon afterwards, people invited sick monks to a meal. Knowing that the Master had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. They informed the Master of what had happened. He spoke on the Dhamma and then addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow you to eat in a group with a sick monk. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3 id="anupannatti2">Preliminary ruling</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">6</span>
“If a monk eats in a group, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. The appropriate reason is this: a monk is sick."</p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">7</span>
In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>

<h3 id="anunidana3">Third sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.32.3"></a>Around that time, during the robe-giving season, people prepared a meal together with robe-cloth, and then invited the monks: “We wish to offer you a meal and then give you robe-cloth." Knowing that the Master had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.308"></a> As a result they only obtained a small amount of robe-cloth. They informed the Master of what had happened. … “Monks, I allow you to eat in a group when robe-cloth is being given. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3 id="anupannatti3">Preliminary ruling</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">9</span>
“If a monk eats in a group, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. The appropriate reasons are these: a monk is sick, robe-cloth is being given."</p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">10</span>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>

<h3 id="anunidana4">Fourth sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">11</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.32.4"></a>Around that time, people invited monks who were making a robe for a meal. Knowing that the Master had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. They informed the Master of what had happened. … “Monks, I allow you to eat in a group when a robe is being made. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3 id="anupannatti4">Preliminary ruling</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">12</span>“If a monk eats in a group, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. The appropriate reasons are these: a monk is sick, robe-cloth is being given, a robe is being made."</p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">13</span>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>

<h3 id="anunidana5">Fifth sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">14</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.32.5"></a>Around that time, monks <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.73"></a> went travelling with some people. Then those monks said to those people: “Please wait a moment while we walk for alms." They replied: “Bhante, please eat right here." <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.309"></a> Knowing that the Master had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. They informed the Master of what had happened. … “Monks, I allow you to eat in a group while you are travelling. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3 id="anupannatti5">Preliminary ruling</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">15</span>“If a monk eats in a group, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. The appropriate reasons are these: a monk is sick, robe-cloth is being given, a robe is being made, a monk is travelling on a road."</p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">16</span>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>

<h3 id="anunidana6">Sixth sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">17</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.32.6"></a>Around that time, monks boarded a boat with some people. Then those monks said to those people: “Please go to the shore for a moment while we walk for alms." They replied: “Bhante, please eat right here." Knowing that the Master had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. They informed the Master of what had happened. … “Monks, I allow you to eat in a group while you are on-board a boat. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3 id="anupannatti6">Preliminary ruling</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">18</span>“If a monk eats in a group, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. The appropriate reasons are these: a monk is sick, robe-cloth is being given, a robe is being made, a monk is travelling on a road, a monk is travelling by boat."</p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">19</span>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>

<h3 id="anunidana7">Seventh sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">20</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.32.7"></a>Around that time, monks who had completed the rainy season in that region were coming to Rājagaha to see the Master. People saw those monks who had come from various <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.310"></a> countries and they invited them for a meal. Knowing that the Master had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. They informed the Master of what had happened. … “Monks, I allow you to eat in a group on big occasions. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h3 id="anupannatti7">Preliminary ruling</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">21</span>“If a monk eats in a group, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. The appropriate reasons are these: a monk is sick, robe-cloth is being given, a robe is being made, a monk is travelling on a road, a monk is travelling by boat, it is a big occasion."</p>

<p class="endsection"><span class="parno">22</span>In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>

<h3 id="anunidana8">Eighth sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">23</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.74"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.32.8"></a>Around that time, a relative of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Māgadha who had gone forth among the Ājīvakas approached the King and said: “Great King, I wish to make a meal for the followers of all sects."<br>

<br>“Thatʼs fine, bhante, if you first feed the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha."<br>

<br>“I will do that."<br>

<br>Then that Ājīvaka sent a messenger to the monks: “Please accept a meal from me tomorrow." But knowing that the Master had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. Then that Ājīvaka went to the Master, exchanged friendly greetings with him, <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.311"></a> and stood to one side. And he said this: “Good Gotama has gone forth and so have I. One who has gone forth is entitled to give alms to another who has gone forth. Good Gotama, please accept a meal from me tomorrow, together with the Sangha of monks." The Master consented by remaining silent. The Ājīvaka understood that the Master had consented and he left.<br>

<br>The Master then spoke on the Dhamma and addressed the monks: “Monks, I allow you to eat in a group when the meal is being given by an ascetic. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>

<h2 id="pannatti">Final ruling</h2>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">24</span>“If a monk eats in a group, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. The appropriate reasons are these: a monk is sick, robe-cloth is being given, a robe is being made, a monk is travelling on a road, a monk is travelling by boat, it is a big occasion, the meal is being given by an ascetic."</p>

<h2 id="pada">Definitions</h2>

<p><span class="parno">25</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.32.9"></a><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.32.9.1"></a>Eats in a group: wherever four monks, after being invited, eat any of the five staple foods. This is called ‘eats in a group.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">26</span>Unless there is an appropriate reason: except at an appropriate time.</p>

<p><span class="parno">27</span>A monk is sick: even if he just has split feet, he may eat in a group. </p>

<p><span class="parno">28</span>Robe-cloth is being given: if he has not done the <i>kathina</i> ceremony, he may eat in a group during the last month of the rainy season. <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.312"></a> If he has done the <i>kathina</i> ceremony, he may eat in a group during the five month period.<span class="note"> <span class="details"><span class="p">That is, the last month of the rainy season, plus the four months of the cold season,</span></span></span></p>

<p><span class="parno">29</span>A robe is being made: when a robe is being made, he may eat in a group.</p>

<p><span class="parno">30</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.4.75"></a>A monk is travelling on a road: if he intends to travel at least six kilometres, he may eat in a group.<span class="note"> <span class="details"><span class="p">Half a <i>yojana</i>. The length of a <i>yojana</i> has not been precisely established (perhaps it never was a precise distance), but a reasonable estimate is 8 miles or just under 13 kilometres (see T.W. Rhys Davids, “On the Ancient Coins and Measures of Ceylon", p.16). Thus half <i>yojana</i> is just over 6 km.</span></span></span> And he may eat in a group while travelling, and after travelling.</p>

<p><span class="parno">31</span>A monk is travelling by boat: if he intends to board a boat, he may eat in a group. And he may eat in a group while on-board, and after disembarking.</p>

<p><span class="parno">32</span>It is a big occasion: if two or three monks can get by by walking for alms, but not a group of four, he may eat in a group. </p>

<p><span class="parno">33</span>The meal is given by an ascetic: if any kind of wanderer is making the meal, he may eat in a group.</p>

<p><span class="parno">34</span>If he receives it intending to eat it, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence of bad conduct. For every mouthful, he commits an offence entailing confession.</p>

<h2 id="cakka">Permutations</h2>

<p><span class="parno">35</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.32.9.2"></a>If it is a group meal, and he perceives it as a group meal, and he eats, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. If it is a group meal, but he has doubts about it, and he eats, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession. If it is a group meal, but he does not perceive it as a group meal, and he eats, unless there is an appropriate reason, he commits an offence entailing confession.</p>

<p><span class="parno">36</span>If it is not a group meal, but he perceives it as a group meal, he commits an offence of bad conduct. If it is not a group meal, but he has doubts about it, <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.313"></a> he commits an offence of bad conduct. If it is not a group meal, and he does not perceive it as a group meal, there is no offence.</p>

<h2 id="anapatti">Non-offences</h2>

<p><span class="parno">37</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pc.32.9.3"></a>There is no offence: if he has an appropriate reason; if two or three eat together; if they eat together after walking for alms; if it is a regular meal invitation; if it is a meal invitation decided by drawing lots; if it is on the half-moon day; if it is on the <i>uposatha</i> day; if <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.2.314"></a> it is on the day after the <i>uposatha</i>; if it is anything apart from the five staple foods; if he is insane; if he is the first offender.</p>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">38</span>The second rule, the training rule on group meals, is finished.</p>
