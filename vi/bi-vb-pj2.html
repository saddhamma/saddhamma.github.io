<h3>First sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.2"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.2.1"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.1"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.64"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.41"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.191"></a>
At one time the Buddha, the Master, was staying at Rājagaha on Mount Vultureʼs Peak. Now at that time a number of monks who were friends made grass huts on the slope of Mount Isigili and entered the rains there. Among them was Venerable Dhaniya, the potterʼs son. Then, after three months, when the rains (residence) was over, the monks demolished their grass huts, put away the grass and wood and departed to wander around the country. But Venerable Dhaniya spent the rains there, and the winter and the summer. Then, while Venerable Dhaniya was in the village collecting alms, women gathering grass and firewood demolished the grass hut and took away the grass and sticks. A second time Venerable Dhaniya collected grass and sticks and made a grass hut. A second time, while Venerable Dhaniya was in the village collecting alms, women gathering grass and firewood demolished the grass hut and took away the grass and sticks. And the same thing happened a third time.</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.192"></a>
 Then Venerable Dhaniya thought: "Three times
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.65"></a>
 this has happened. But I am well-trained and experienced in my own craft, the potterʼs craft. Perhaps I should knead mud myself and make a hut consisting of nothing but clay?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.193"></a>
 Then Venerable Dhaniya
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.42"></a>
 did just that. He then collected grass, wood and cow-dung and baked his hut. It was a beautiful, lovely and charming little hut, and it was red just like a scarlet rain-mite. And (when hit) it sounded just like the sound of a bell.</p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.2"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.194"></a>
Then the Master, descending from Mount Vultureʼs Peak with a number of monks, saw the hut. He then addressed the monks:<br>
<br>"Monks, what is this beautiful, lovely and charming thing, which is red like a scarlet rain-mite?" The monks then informed the Master. The Buddha, the Master, was critical, saying:<br>
<br>
"It is not suitable, monks, for that foolish man, it is not fit, it is not becoming, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it should not be done. For how could that foolish man make a hut out of nothing but clay? Certainly this foolish man can have no consideration, compassion and mercy for living beings.
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.66"></a>
Go, monks, and demolish this hut. Do not let future generations take up the destruction of living beings.
<span class="rule">And, monks, a hut consisting of nothing but clay should not be made. If one does, there is an offence of bad conduct.</span>"<br>
<br>
"Yes, bhante," the monks replied, and they went to that hut and <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.67"></a>
demolished it. Then Venerable Dhaniya said to those monks:<br>
<br>"Why, friends, are you demolishing my hut?"<br>
<br>"Friend, the Master has asked us to."<br>
<br>"Demolish it, friends, if the Lord of the Dhamma has said so."</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.3"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.195"></a>
Then Venerable Dhaniya thought: "Three times, while I was in the village collecting alms, women gathering grass and firewood demolished my hut and took away the grass and sticks. And now my hut made of nothing but clay has been demolished at the Masterʼs request. Now the overseer of the wood-yard is a friend of mine. Perhaps I should ask him for wood and make a hut out of it?"</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">6</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.196"></a>
Then Venerable Dhaniya approached the overseer of the wood-yard and said this: "Three times, friend, while I was in the village collecting alms, women gathering grass and firewood … has been demolished at the Masterʼs request. Give me some wood, friend, I want to make a wooden hut."<br>
<br>
"There is no such wood, bhante, that I could give you. <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.43"></a>
This wood is held by the king, and it is meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergency. Only if the king gives it, may you take it."<br>
<br>"Friend, it has been given by the king."</p>

<p><span class="parno">7</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.197"></a>
Then the overseer of the wood-yard thought: "These recluses, sons of the Sakyan, are followers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, of just conduct, committed to the spiritual life, speakers of truth, virtuous, of good conduct. Even the king has faith in these. He would not say something is given if it were not." Then the overseer of the wood-yard said to Venerable Dhaniya
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.68"></a>
 : "You may take it, bhante." Then Venerable Dhaniya had that wood broken up into pieces, removed it by means of carts and made a wooden hut.</p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.4"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.198"></a>
Now the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, while he was inspecting the works in Rājagaha, went to the overseer of the wood-yard and said to him: "What is going on: where is the wood held by the king that is meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergency?"<br>
<br>"Sir, that wood was given by the king to master Dhaniya."</p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.199"></a>
Then the brahmin Vassakāra was upset: "How could the king give away the wood, which is meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergency, to Dhaniya, the potterʼs son?"<br>
<br>Then the brahmin Vassakāra went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and said to him: "Is it true, sire, that the wood held by the king, meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergency, were given by the king to Dhaniya, the potterʼs son?"<br>
<br>"Who said that?"<br>
<br>"The overseer of the wood-yard, sire."<br>
<br>"Well then, brahmin, send for the overseer of the wood-yard." Then Vassakāra had the overseer of the wood-yard bound and taken by force.</p>

<p><span class="parno">10</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.200"></a>
Venerable Dhaniya saw the overseer of the wood-yard being
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.69"></a>
 bound and taken by force and said to him: "Friend, why is this happening to you?"<br>
<br>"Because of the business with that wood, bhante."<br>
<br>"Go, friend, and I too will come."<br>
<br>"Please come before I am done for, bhante."</p>

<p><span class="parno">11</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.5"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.201"></a>
Then Venerable Dhaniya went to the dwelling of King Bimbisāra and sat down on the appointed seat. Then King Bimbisāra approached Venerable Dhaniya,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.44"></a>
 paid homage to him and sat down to one side. King Bimbisāra then said this to him:<br>
<br>"Is it true, bhante, that the wood held by the king, meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of emergency, have been given by me to the master?"<br>
<br>"Yes, great king."<br>
<br>"We kings are very busy—having given, we may not remember. Please remind me, bhante."<br>
<br>"Do you remember, great king, when you were first anointed, speaking these words: ʻLet the recluses and brahmins enjoy gifts of grass, sticks and waterʼ?"<br>
<br>
"I remember, bhante. There are recluses and brahmins who have a sense of shame, are scrupulous and desirous of training. They have a sense of conscience even in regard to small matters. What was uttered by me was meant for these, and it concerned what is ownerless in the wilderness. Yet you, bhante, imagine you can take wood not given to you by means of this trick? But how could one like me flog, <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.70"></a>
imprison or banish a recluse or a brahmin living in my kingdom? Go, you are free because of your status, but do not do such a thing again."</p>

<p><span class="parno">12</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.2.1.6"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.202"></a>
People criticised and denounced him: "These recluses, the sons of the Sakyan, are shameless, immoral, liars. They claim to be followers of <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>, of just conduct, committed to the spiritual life, speakers of truth, virtuous, of good conduct. But there is no recluseship or brahminhood among these—it is lost to them. Where is recluseship and brahminhood among them? They have departed from it. They even deceive the king; what then other people?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.203"></a>
Monks heard the criticism of those people. Those monks who had few desires and a sense of shame, who were contented, scrupulous, and desirous of training, criticised and denounced Venerable Dhaniya: "How could he take wood belonging to the king that had not been given to him?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.204"></a>
 Then these monks informed the Master. And in this connection the Master convened the Sangha of monks and questoned Venerable Dhaniya:<br>
<br>"Is it true, Dhaniya, that you have taken wood belonging to the king that was not given to you?"<br>
<br>"It is true, Master."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.71"></a>
The Buddha, the Master, rebuked him: "Foolish man, it is not suitable, it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it is not to be done. How could you
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.45"></a>
 take wood belonging to the king that has not been given to you? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it, nor increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds."</p>

<p><span class="parno">15</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.205"></a>
Now at that time a certain former chief minister of justice who had gone forth among the monks was sitting near the Master. The Master said to him: "For what amount of theft, monk, does King Bimbisāra flog, imprison or banish a thief?"<br>
<br>
"For a <i lang="pi">pāda</i>, Master, for the worth of a <i lang="pi">pāda</i>, or for more than a <i lang="pi">pāda</i>."<br>
<br>
Now at that time in Rājagaha a
<i lang="pi">pāda</i> was worth
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.72"></a>
 five <i lang="pi">māsakas</i>. Then the Master, having rebuked Venerable Dhaniya in several ways for being difficult to support … " … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>

<p><span class="parno">16</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.206"></a><strong>
<span class="subrule">"If a monk takes by way of theft what has not been given to him—the sort of theft for which kings, having caught a thief, would flog, imprison or banish him, saying, ʻYou are a robber, you are foolish, you have gone astray, you are a thiefʼ—he too is expelled and not in communion."</span></strong></p>
<p class="end"><span class="parno">17</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.207"></a>
Thus the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>

<p><span class="parno">18</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Bu-Pj.2.2"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="MS.208"></a>
At one time the group of six monks went to the dyersʼ spread (of dyed cloth), carried off the dyersʼ goods, took it to the monastery and divided it out. Other monks said:<br>
<br>"Friends, you have great merit, for many robes have accrued to you."<br>
<br>"How is there merit for us, friends? Just now we went to the dyersʼ spread (of dyed cloth) and carried off the dyersʼ goods."<br>
<br>"Friends, hasnʼt a training rule been laid down by the Master? Why then do you carry off the dyersʼ goods?"<br>
<br>"It is true, friends, that a training rule has been laid down by the Master, but it concerns the village, not the wilderness."<br>
<br>
"But, friends, that is just the same. <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.1.73"></a>
It is not suitable, it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it should not be done. How could you carry off the dyersʼs goods? It will not give rise to confidence in those without it, nor increase the confidence of those who have it, but it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds."<br>
<br>
Then those monks, having rebuked the group of six monks in various ways,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.3.46"></a>
informed the Master.</p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.209"></a> And in this connection the Master convened the Sangha and questoned the group of six monks:<br>
<br>"Is it true, monks, that you went the dyersʼ spread (of dyed cloth) and carried off the dyersʼ goods?"<br>
<br>"It is true, Master."<br>
<br>
The Buddha, the Master, rebuked them: "it is not suitable, foolish men, it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is not worthy of a recluse, it is not allowable, it should not be done. How could you go to the dyersʼ spread (of dyed cloth) and carry off the dyersʼ goods? It will not give rise to confidence in those without it … to change their minds." Then the Master, rebuking the group of six monks in various ways, spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … but he spoke in praise … of the putting forth of energy. Having given a <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i> talk on what was right and seemly, he addressed the monks … " … And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p class="rule"><span class="parno">20</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.210"></a>
"If a monk takes by way of theft from a village or from the wilderness what has not been given to him—the sort of theft for which kings, having caught a thief, would flog, imprison or banish him, saying, ʻYou are a robber, you are foolish, you have gone astray, you are a thiefʼ—he too is expelled and not in communion."</p>

 discontent, took a turban from a shopkeeper. He then said to Venerable Daḷhika, "Bhante, I am no longer a recluse, I will leave the Sangha."<br>
<br>
"But what have you done, friend?" He told him. Having had the turban brought, Venerable Daḷhika valued it, and it was not worth five <i lang="pi">māsakas</i>. "Friend, there is no offence entailing expulsion," and he gave a talk on the <i lang="pi">Dhamma</i>. That monk was delighted.</p>
<p class="end"><span class="parno">185</span><a class="pts_pn" id="MS.375"></a>
The second offence entailing expulsion is finished.</p>
