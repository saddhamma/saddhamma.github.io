<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.379"></a>
At one time the awakened one, the Lord was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeling-place. Now at that time Vesālī was prosperous and flourishing, full of folk, thronged with people, and it was well off for food; and there were seven thousand seven hundred and seven long houses, and seven thousand seven hundred and seven gabled buildings, and seven thousand seven hundred and seven parks, and seven thousand seven hundred and seven lotus-tanks. There was the courtesan Ambapālī, beautiful, good to look upon, charming, she was possessed of the utmost beauty of complexion, was clever at dancing and singing and lute-playing, much visited by desirous people and she went for a night for fifty, and through her Vesālī shone forth all the more.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.2" href="#Kd.8.1.2"></a>
Then the urban council of Rājagaha went to Vesālī on some business. The urban council of Rājagaha saw that Vesālī was prosperous and flourishing, full of folk, thronged with people, and well off for food; and (they saw) the seven thousand seven hundred and seven long houses … seven thousand seven hundred and seven lotus-tanks, and Ambapālī, the courtesan, beautiful, good to look upon, charming … and (they saw) that through her Vesālī shone forth all the more.
</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>
Then the urban council of Rājagaha, having transacted that business in Vesālī, came back again to Rājagaha; they approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha; having approached they spoke thus to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha:<br>
<br>
"Sire, Vesālī is prosperous and flourishing … and through her Vesālī shines forth all the more. It were good, sire, if we too might establish a courtesan." <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.380"></a>
"Well now, good sirs, do find such a girl as you might establish as a courtesan."</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.3" href="#Kd.8.1.3"></a>
Now at that time there was in Rājagaha a girl called Sālavatī, who was beautiful, good to look upon, charming, she was possessed of the utmost beauty of complexion. Then the urban council of Rājagaha established the girl, Sālavatī,
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.269"></a>
 as courtesan. And the courtesan Sālavatī soon came to be clever at dancing and singing and lute-playing; she was much visited by desirous people, and she went for a night for the fee of a hundred. Then the courtesan Sālavatī soon became pregnant. Then it occurred to the courtesan Sālavatī: "Men do not like a pregnant woman. If anyone should find out concerning me that ‘The courtesan Sālavatī is pregnant’, all respect for me would dwindle. What now if I should make it known that I am ill?"<br>
<br>Then the courtesan Sālavatī enjoined the door-keeper, saying: "Good door-keeper, do not let any man come in, and if anyone asks for me, make it known that I am ill."<br>
<br>"Very well, lady," that door-keeper answered the courtesan Sālavatī in assent.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.4" href="#Kd.8.1.4"></a>
Then the courtesan Sālavatī when (the child of) her womb was mature, gave birth to a son. Then the courtesan Sālavatī enjoined a slave-woman, saying: "Now then, come along, having put this boy into a winnowing-basket, having taken him out, throw him away on a rubbish-heap."<br>
<br>"Very well, lady," and that slave-woman having answered the courtesan Sālavatī in assent, having put that boy into a winnowing-basket, having taken him out, threw him away on a rubbish-heap.</p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>

Now at that time the king’s son, Abhaya by name, going in the morning to the royal audience, saw that boy surrounded <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.381"></a>
by crows; seeing this, he asked the people: "Good sirs, what is this that is surrounded by crows?" <br>
<br>"It is a boy, sire."<br>
<br>"Is he alive, good sirs?"<br>
<br>"He is alive, sire."<br>
<br>"Well now, good sirs, having brought that boy to our women’s quarters, give him to foster-mothers to care for."<br>
<br>"Very well, sire," and these people having answered Abhaya, the king’s son, in assent, having brought that boy to the women’s quarters of Abhaya, the king’s son, gave him to foster-mothers saying, "Care for him".<br>
<br>Because it was said of him, "He is alive", they gave him the name of Jīvaka; because the prince caused him to be cared for, they gave him the name of Komārabhacca.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.5" href="#Kd.8.1.5"></a>
And before long Jīvaka Komārabhacca attained to years of discretion. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached Abhaya, the king’s son, and having approached he spoke thus to Abhaya, the king’s son:<br>
<br>"Who, sire, is my mother? Who my father?" <br>
<br>"Not even I, good Jīvaka, know your mother, but I am your father, for I had you cared for."<br>
<br>Then it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca:<br>
<br>"Without a craft, it is not easy to depend upon these royal families. Suppose I were to learn a craft?"
</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>
Now at that time there lived a world-famed doctor at Taxilā.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.6" href="#Kd.8.1.6"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, without having asked (permission) of Abhaya, the king’s son, set out for Taxilā;
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.270"></a>
 in course of time he arrived at Taxilā and that doctor; having approached, he spoke thus to that doctor:<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.382"></a>
"I want, teacher, to train in the craft."<br>
<br>"Well then, good Jīvaka, train in it."<br>
<br>Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca learnt much and learnt it quickly, and he reflected upon it well, and he did not forget what he had learnt. Then at the end of seven years, it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "I am learning much and learning it quickly, and I am reflecting upon it well, and I do not forget what I have learnt, but after studying for seven years the end of this craft is not visible to me. When will the end of this craft be visible?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.7" href="#Kd.8.1.7"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached that doctor; having approached he spoke thus to that doctor:<br>
<br>"I, teacher, am learning much and learning it quickly, and I am reflecting upon it well, and I do not forget what I have learnt, but after studying for seven years the end of this craft is not visible to me. When will the end of this craft be visible?"<br>
<br>
"Well now, good Jīvaka, taking a spade, touring a <i lang="pi">yojana</i> all round Taxilā, bring whatever you should see that is not medicinal."<br>
<br>
"Very well, teacher," and Jīvaka Komārabhacca having answered that doctor in assent, taking a spade, touring a <i lang="pi">yojana</i> all round Taxilā, did not see anything that was not medicinal. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached that doctor; having approached he spoke thus to that doctor:<br>
<br>
"Teacher, while I was touring for a <i lang="pi">yojana</i> all round Taxilā, I did not see any thing that was not medicinal."<br>
<br>"You are trained, good Jīvaka, this much is enough for a livelihood for you," and he gave him trifling provisions for the journey.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.8" href="#Kd.8.1.8"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, taking those trifling provisions for the journey, set out for Rājagaha. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s trifling provisions for the journey became used up on the way, at Sāketa. Then it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca:<br>
<br>"These wilderness roads have little water, little food; it is not easy to go along them without provisions for the journey. Suppose I were to look about for provisions for the journey?"</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>

Now at that time in Sāketa a merchant’s wife had had a <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.383"></a>
disease of the head for seven years. Many very great, world-famed doctors who had come had not been able to cure her; taking much gold, they went away. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, entering Sāketa, asked the people: "Who, good sirs, is ill? Whom shall I attend?"<br>
<br>
"Teacher, this merchant’s wife <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.271"></a>
has had a disease of the head for seven years; go, teacher, attend this merchant’s wife."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.9" href="#Kd.8.1.9"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca went up to the dwelling of that householder, the merchant, and having gone up, he enjoined the door-keeper, saying: "Go, good door-keeper, say to the merchant’s wife, ‘Lady, a doctor is come who wants to see you’".<br>
<br>"Very well, teacher," and that door-keeper having answered Jīvaka Komārabhacca in assent, approached that merchant’s wife; having approached, he spoke thus to that merchant’s wife: "Lady, a doctor is come who wants to see you."<br>
<br>"What sort of a doctor is he, good door-keeper?"<br>
<br>"He is young, lady."<br>
<br>"That’s enough, good door-keeper. What could a young doctor do for me? Many very great, world-famed doctors who have come have not been able to cure me; they have gone away taking much gold."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.10" href="#Kd.8.1.10"></a>
Then that door-keeper went up to Jīvaka Komārabhacca; having gone up, he spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "Teacher, the merchant’s wife speaks thus: ‘That’s enough, good door-keeper … taking much gold’."<br>
<br>"Go, good door-keeper, say to the merchant’s wife: ‘Lady, the doctor speaks thus: Do not, lady, give anything beforehand; when you become well, then you may give what you like’."<br>
<br>"Very well, teacher," and that door-keeper having answered Jīvaka Komārabhacca in assent, went up to that merchant’s wife; having gone up, he spoke thus to that merchant’s wife: "Lady, the doctor speaks thus … ‘ … then you may give what you like’."<br>
<br>"Well then, good door-keeper, let the doctor come."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.384"></a>
"Very well, lady," and that door-keeper having answered the merchant’s wife in assent, went up to Jīvaka Komārabhacca; having gone up, he spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca:<br>
<br>"The merchant’s wife, teacher, summons you."</p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.11" href="#Kd.8.1.11"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca went up to that merchant’s wife; having gone up, having observed her uneasiness, he spoke thus to the merchant’s wife:<br>
<br>"Lady, a handful of ghee is wanted."<br>
<br>Then that merchant’s wife had a handful of ghee given to Jīvaka Komārabhacca. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, cooking up that handful of ghee with various medicines, made that merchant’s wife lie down on her back on a couch and gave it (to her) through the nose. Then that ghee, given through the nose, came out through the mouth. Then that merchant’s wife, spitting it into a receptacle, enjoined a slave-woman, saying:<br>
<br>"Come, now, take up this ghee with cotton."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.12" href="#Kd.8.1.12"></a>
Then it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "It is astonishing how stingy this housewife is, in that she has this ghee, which ought to be thrown away, taken up with cotton;
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.272"></a>
 many of my very precious medicines went into it, and what kind of a fee will she give me?"<br>
<br>Then that merchant’s wife, having observed Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s uneasiness, spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "Teacher, why are you perturbed?"<br>
<br>"It occurred to me in this case: it is astonishing … will she give me?"<br>
<br>"But, teacher, we householders know about this economy; this ghee is excellent for the servants or workmen for rubbing their feet, or poured out into a lamp. Do not you, teacher, be perturbed, your fee will not be lacking."</p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>
<a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.13" href="#Kd.8.1.13"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca removed the merchant’s wife’s seven year old disease of the head by just the one treatment
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.385"></a>
 through the nose. Then that merchant’s wife, being well, gave four thousand to Jīvaka Komārabhacca; her son, thinking, "My mother is well", gave four thousand; her daughter-in-law, thinking, "My mother-in-law is well", gave four thousand; the householder, the merchant, thinking, "My wife is well", gave four thousand and a slave and a slave-woman and a horse-chariot.
<p>


<p><span class="parno">10</span> Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, taking these sixteen thousand and the slave and the slave-woman and the horse-chariot, set out for Rājagaha; in due course he approached Abhaya, the king’s son, at Rājagaha; having approached he spoke thus to Abhaya, the king’s son:<br>
<br>"Sire, this is for my first work: sixteen thousand and a slave and a slave-woman and a horse-chariot. May your highness accept it as a tribute for having had me cared for."<br>
<br>"No, good Jīvaka, let it be for you yourself; but do build a dwelling in our palace."<br>
<br>"Very well, sire," and Jīvaka Komārabhacca having answered Abhaya, the king’s son, in assent, built a dwelling in the palace of Abhaya, the king’s son.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">11</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.14" href="#Kd.8.1.14"></a>
Now at that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha came to suffer from a fistula; his outer garments were stained with blood. The queens, seeing this, made fun of him, saying: "Now the king is in his courses, the king is having a period, soon the king will give birth." On account of this the king became ashamed. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha spoke thus to Abhaya, the king’s son:<br>
<br>"Good Abhaya, I have such a disease that my outer garments are stained with blood. The queens, seeing this, make fun of me, saying, ‘ … the king will give birth’. Please, good Abhaya, do find a doctor such as could attend me."<br>
<br>"Sire, there is this Jīvaka of ours, a young doctor of high repute, he will attend your majesty."<br>
<br>
"Very well, good Abhaya, <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.273"></a>
command the doctor, Jīvaka, so that he shall attend me."</p>

<p><span class="parno">12</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.15" href="#Kd.8.1.15"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.386"></a>
Then Abhaya, the king’s son, commanded Jīvaka Komārabhacca, saying: "Go, good Jīvaka, attend the king."<br>
<br>"Very well, sire," and Jīvaka Komārabhaccahaving answered Abhaya, the king’s son, in assent, taking medicine under his nail, approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha; having approached, he spoke thus to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha:<br>
<br>"Sire, let me see the disease."<br>
<br>Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca removed King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha’s fistula with just the one ointment. Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, being well, having had five hundred women adorned with all kinds of ornaments, having made them take (these) off, having had them made into a pile, spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "Let all these ornaments of the five hundred women be yours, good Jīvaka."<br>
<br>"No, sire, may your majesty remember my office."<br>
<br>"Well then, good Jīvaka, may you tend me and the women and the Order of monks with the awakened one at its head."<br>
<br>"Very well, sire," Jīvaka Komārabhacca answered King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha in assent.</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">13</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.16" href="#Kd.8.1.16"></a>
Now at that time a merchant of Rājagaha had had a disease of the head for seven years. Many very great, world-famed doctors who had come had not been able to cure him. Taking much gold, they went away. Moreover he came to be given up by the doctors. Some doctors spoke thus: "The householder, the merchant will pass away on the fifth day." Some doctors spoke thus: "The householder, the merchant will pass away on the seventh day." Then it occurred to the urban council of Rājagaha: "This householder, the merchant is very useful to the king as well as to the urban council, but yet he has been given up by the doctors. Some doctors speak thus: ‘The householder, the merchant will pass away on the fifth day.’ Some doctors speak thus: ‘The householder, the merchant will pass away on the seventh day.’ Now, this Jīvaka, the king’s doctor, is young and of good repute. Suppose we should ask Jīvaka, the king’s doctor, to attend the householder, the merchant?"</p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.17" href="#Kd.8.1.17"></a>
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.387"></a>
Then the urban council of Rājagaha approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha; having approached they spoke thus to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha:<br>
<br>
"Sire, this householder, the merchant is very useful to your majesty as well as to the citizens; but then he is given up by the doctors … ‘ … will die on the seventh day’. It were good if your majesty were to command Jīvaka, the doctor, to attend the householder, the merchant." <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.274"></a>
</p>

<p><span class="parno">15</span>Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha commanded Jīvaka Komārabhacca, saying: "Go, good Jivaka, attend the householder, the merchant."<br>
<br>"Very well, sire," and Jīvaka Komārabhaccahaving answered King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha in assent, approached that householder, the merchant; having approached, having observed the uneasiness of the householder, the merchant, he spoke thus to the householder, the merchant:<br>
<br>"If I, householder, should make you well, what would be my fee?"<br>
<br>"All my property shall become yours, teacher, and I will be your slave."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.18" href="#Kd.8.1.18"></a>
"Now, householder, are you able to lie down on one side for seven months?"<br>
<br>"I am able, teacher, to lie down on one side for seven months."<br>
<br>"Now, householder, are you able to lie down on the other side for seven months?"<br>
<br>"I am able, teacher, to lie down on the other side for seven months."<br>
<br>"Now, householder, are you able to lie down on your back for seven months?"<br>
<br>"I am able, teacher, to lie down on my back for seven months."</p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, having made the householder, the merchant lie down on a couch, having strapped him to the couch, having cut open the skin of his head, having opened a suture in the skull, having drawn out two living creatures, showed them to the people, saying:<br>
<br>
"Do you see, masters, these two living creatures, the one small, the other large? This large living creature was seen <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.388"></a>
by those teachers who spoke thus: ‘The householder, the merchant will pass away on the fifth day’; on the fifth day it would have destroyed the brain of the householder, the merchant, and when the brain had been destroyed the householder, the merchant would have passed away. It was rightly seen by those teachers. This small living creature was seen by those teachers who spoke thus: ‘The householder, the merchant will pass away on the seventh day’; on the seventh day it would have destroyed the brain of the householder, the merchant, and when the brain had been destroyed the householder, the merchant would have passed away. It was rightly seen by those teachers." And having closed the suture of the skull, having sewn up the skin of the head, he applied an ointment.</p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.19" href="#Kd.8.1.19"></a>
Then the householder, the merchant, when seven days had passed, spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca:<br>
<br>"I am not able, teacher, to lie down on one side for seven months."<br>
<br>"But did you not, householder, answer me in assent, saying: ‘I am able, teacher, to he down on one side for seven months’?"<br>
<br>"It is true, teacher, that I answered thus, but I will die, I am not able to lie down on one side for seven months."<br>
<br>"Well then, householder, you lie down on the other side for seven months."</p>

<p><span class="parno">18</span>
Then the householder, the merchant, when seven days had passed, spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.275"></a>
<br>
<br>"I am not able, teacher, to lie down on the other side for seven months."<br>
<br>"But did you not, householder, answer me in assent, saying: ‘I am able, teacher, to lie down on the other side for seven months’?"<br>
<br>"It is true, teacher, that I answered thus, but I will die, I am not able to lie down on the other side for seven months."<br>
<br>"Well then, householder, you lie down on your back for seven months."</p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>Then the householder, the merchant, when seven days had passed, spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca:<br>
<br>"I am not able, teacher, to lie down on my back for seven months."<br>
<br>
"But did you not, householder, answer me in assent, saying: <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.389"></a>
‘I am able, teacher, to lie down on my back for seven months’?<br>
<br>"It is true, teacher, that I answered thus, but I will die I am not able to lie down on my back for seven months."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.20" href="#Kd.8.1.20"></a>
"If I, householder, had not spoken to you thus, you would not have lain down so long (as this); but I knew beforehand that the householder, the merchant would become well in three times seven days. Rise up, householder, you are well; find what is my fee."<br>
<br>"All my property shall become yours, teacher, and I will be your slave."<br>
<br>"No, householder, do not give me all your property and do not be my slave; give a hundred thousand to the king and a hundred thousand to me."<br>
<br>Then the householder, the merchant, being well, gave a hundred thousand to the king and a hundred thousand to Jīvaka Komārabhacca.</p>

Now at that time the son of a merchant of Benares, while playing at turning somersaults, came to suffer from a twist in the bowels, so that he did not properly digest the conjey that he drank nor did he properly digest the food that he ate or relieve himself regularly. Because of this he became thin, wretched, his colour bad, yellowish, the veins showing all over his body. Then it occurred to the merchant of Benares:<br>
<br>"Now what kind of affliction has my son? He does not properly digest the conjey that he drinks and he does not properly digest the food that he eats and he does not relieve himself regularly. Because of this he is thin, wretched, of a bad colour, yellowish, the veins showing all over his body. What now if I, having gone to Rājagaha, should ask the king for Jīvaka, the doctor, to attend my son?"<br>
<br>Then the merchant of Benares, having gone to Rājagaha, approached King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha; having approached, he spoke thus to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha:<br>
<br>
"Sire, my son has this kind of affliction: he does not
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.390"></a>
properly digest … the veins showing all over his body. It were good if your majesty
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.276"></a>
 were to command Jīvaka, the doctor, to attend my son."</p>

<p><span class="parno">21</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.22" href="#Kd.8.1.22"></a>
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha commanded Jīvaka Komārabhacca, saying: "Go, good Jīvaka, having gone to Benares, attend the son of the merchant of Benares."<br>
<br>"Very well, sire," and Jīvaka Komārabhacca having answered King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha in assent, having gone to Benares, approached the son of the merchant of Benares; having approached, having observed the uneasiness of the son of the merchant of Benares, having caused the people to be turned away, having surrounded him with a curtain, having tied him to a post, having placed his wife in front (of him), having cut open the skin of his stomach, having drawn out the twisted bowel, showed it to his wife, saying: "See, this was your husband’s affliction; because of this he did not properly digest the conjey that he drank and did not properly digest the food that he ate and did not relieve himself regularly; because of this he is thin, wretched, his colour bad, yellowish, the veins showing all over his body." Having straightened out the twisted bowel, having put back the bowel again, having sewn up the skin of the stomach, he applied an ointment. Then the son of the merchant of Benares soon became well. Then the merchant of Benares, saying: "My son is well," gave sixteen thousand to Jīvaka Komārabhacca. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, taking those sixteen thousand, went back again to Rājagaha.</p>

<p><span class="parno">22</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.23" href="#Kd.8.1.23"></a>
Now at that time King Pajjota came to be suffering from jaundice. Many very great, world-famed doctors, who had come had not been able to cure him; taking much gold, they went away. Then King Pajjota sent a messenger to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, saying: "I have this kind of disease; it would be good if your majesty were to command Jīvaka, the doctor, so that he should attend me." Then King Bimbisāra of Magadha commanded Jīvaka Komārabhacca, saying: "Go, good Jīvaka, having gone to Ujjenī, attend King Pajjota."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.391"></a>
"Very well, sire," and Jīvaka Komārabhaccahaving answered King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha in assent, having gone to Ujjenī, approached King Pajjota, and having approached, having observed his uneasiness, he spoke thus to King Pajjota:<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.24" href="#Kd.8.1.24"></a>
"Sire, I will cook up some ghee, and your majesty will drink it."<br>
<br>
"No, good Jīvaka, do what you can to make (me) well without ghee; ghee is abhorrent to me, loathsome." Then it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.277"></a>
"The king’s disease is of such a kind that it is not possible to make him well without ghee. Suppose I should cook up the ghee (so that it has) the colour of an astringent decoction, the smell of an astringent decoction, the taste of an astringent decoction?"<br>
<br>Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca cooked up the ghee with various medicines (so that it had) the colour of an astringent decoction, the smell of an astringent decoction, the taste of an astringent decoction. Then it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "When the king has drunk and digested the ghee, it will make him sick. This king is violent, he might have me killed. Suppose I should ask (for permission to go away) beforehand?" Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached King Pajjota; having approached he spoke thus to King Pajjota:<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.25" href="#Kd.8.1.25"></a>
"Sire, we doctors at such a moment as this are pulling up roots, gathering medicines. It were good if your majesty were to command at the stables and at the gateways, saying: ‘Let Jīvaka go out by means of whatever conveyance he desires, let him go out by whatever gateway he desires, let
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.392"></a>
 him go out at whatever time he desires, let him come in at whatever time he desires’." Then King Pajjota commanded at the stables and at the gateways, saying: "Let Jīvaka go out by means of whatever conveyance he desires, let him go out by whatever gateway he desires, let him go out at whatever time he desires, let him come in at whatever time he desires."<br>
<br>

<p><span class="parno">23</span>
Now at that time King Pajjota had a she-elephant, called Bhaddavatikā, who could do fifty <i lang="pi">yojanas</i>. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca offered the ghee to King Pajjota, saying: "Let your majesty drink an astringent decoction." Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca having made King Pajjota drink the ghee, having gone to the elephant stable, hastened out of the city on the she-elephant, Bhaddavatikā.</p>

<p><span class="parno">24</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.26" href="#Kd.8.1.26"></a>
Then King Pajjota, when he had drunk and digested the ghee, was sick. Then King Pajjota spoke thus to the people: "Good sirs, the wicked Jīvaka has made me drink ghee. Well now, good sirs, look for the doctor, Jīvaka."<br>
<br>"Sire, he has hastened out of the city on the she-elephant, Bhaddavatikā."<br>
<br>
<br>
Now at that time King Pajjota came to have a slave called Kāka, who could do sixty <i lang="pi">yojanas</i> and who was born of a non-human being. Then King Pajjota commanded the slave, Kāka, saying: "Go, good Kāka, make Jīvaka, the doctor, return, saying, ‘The king, teacher, orders you to come back’. Now, good Kāka, these doctors are full of cunning, so do not accept any thing from him."</p>

<p><span class="parno">25</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.27" href="#Kd.8.1.27"></a>
And the slave, Kāka, caught up Jīvaka Komārabhacca on the road to Kosambī as he was having breakfast. Then Kāka, the slave, spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca:
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.278"></a>
 "The king, teacher, orders you to come back."<br>
<br>"Wait, good Kāka, until we have eaten; come, good Kāka, you eat."<br>
<br>"No, teacher, I am commanded by the king, saying: ‘Now good Kāka, these doctors are full of cunning, so do not accept anything from him’."<br>
<br>
<br>
Now at that time Jīvaka Komārabhacca, having stripped <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.393"></a>
off the medicinal (part) with his nail, was eating an emblic myrobalan and drinking water. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to Kāka, the slave: "Here, good Kāka, eat the emblic myrobalan and drink the water."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.28" href="#Kd.8.1.28"></a>
Then Kāka, the slave, thinking: "This doctor is eating the emblic myrobalan and drinking the water, there should not be anything harmful," ate half the emblic myrobalan and drank the water. But he ejected that half emblic myrobalan that he was eating, on the spot. Then Kāka, the slave, spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca:<br>
<br>"Is there life for me, teacher?"<br>
<br>"Do not be afraid, good Kāka, for you will get well; but the king is violent, that king might have me killed, so I am not coming back," and giving the she-elephant, Bhaddavatikā, into Kāka’s charge, he set out for Rājagaha; in due course he approached Rājagaha, and King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha; having approached he told this matter to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha.<br>
<br>"You did well, good Jīvaka, in not going back, that king is violent, he might have you killed."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.29" href="#Kd.8.1.29"></a>
Then King Pajjota, being well, sent a messenger to Jīvaka Komārabhacca, saying: "Let Jīvaka come, I will grant him a boon."<br>
<br>"No, master, let his majesty remember my office."</p>

<p><span class="parno">26</span>
Now at that time there accrued to King Pajjota a pair of Siveyyaka cloths which were the chief and best and foremost and most excellent and loveliest of many cloths, of many pairs <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.394"></a>
of cloths, of many hundred pairs of cloths, of many thousand pairs of cloths, of many hundred thousand pairs of cloths. Then King Pajjota sent this pair of Siveyyaka cloths to Jīvaka Komārabhacca. Then it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca:<br>
<br>"This pair of Siveyyaka cloths, sent me by King Pajjota, is the most excellent and loveliest of many cloths … ; no one else is worthy of it but the Lord, the perfected one, the wholly awakened one, or King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha."</p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">27</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.30" href="#Kd.8.1.30"></a>
Now at that time the Lord came to have a disturbance of the humours of his body. Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.279"></a>
 "Ānanda, the Truth-finder has a disturbance of the humours of his body; the Truth-finder desires to take a purgative." Then the venerable Ānanda approached Jīvaka Komārabhacca; having approached he spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca:<br>
<br>"Jīvaka, sir, the Truth-finder has a disturbance of the humours of his body; the Truth-finder desires to take a purgative."<br>
<br>"Well now, revered Ānanda, lubricate the Truth-finder’s body for a few days." Then the venerable Ānanda, having lubricated the Truth-finder’s body for a few days, approached Jīvaka Komārabhacca; having approached he spoke thus to Jīvaka Komārabhacca:<br>
<br>"Jīvaka, sir, the Truth-finder’s body has been lubricated; what do you think is right for him now?"<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.31" href="#Kd.8.1.31"></a>
Then it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: "It is not suitable that I should give a strong purgative to the Lord," and having had three handfuls of lotuses mixed with various
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.395"></a>
 medicines, he approached the Lord; having approached he offered the Lord one handful of lotuses, saying: "Lord, may the Lord sniff up (the scent of) this first handful of lotuses; this will purge the Lord ten times." Then he offered the Lord the second handful of lotuses, saying: "Lord, may the Lord sniff up (the scent of) this second handful of lotuses; this will purge the Lord ten times." Then he offered the Lord the third handful of lotuses, saying: "Lord, may the Lord sniff up (the scent of) this third handful of lotuses; this will purge the Lord ten times"; thus, he thought that the Lord would be purged all together thirty times. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, having given the Lord a purgative for thirty times all together, having greeted the Lord, departed keeping his right side towards him.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.32" href="#Kd.8.1.32"></a>
Then it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca when he had gone outside the porch: "A purgative has been given by me to the Lord for all together thirty times. The Lord has a disturbance of the humours of his body; it will not purge the Lord all together thirty times, it will purge the Lord twenty-nine times, but then the Lord, being purged, will bathe; when he has bathed, the Lord will purge once, thus the Lord will be purged all together thirty times."
</p>

<p><span class="parno">28</span>Then the Lord, knowing by mind the reasoning in the mind of Jīvaka Komārabhacca, addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:<br>
<br>"Now, Ānanda, it occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca when he had gone outside the porch: ‘A purgative has been given by me to the Lord … thus the Lord will be purged all together thirty times.’ Well now, Ānanda, prepare (some) hot water."<br>
<br>
"Very well, Lord," and the venerable Ānanda having answered the Lord in assent, <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.280"></a>
prepared (some) hot water.</p>

<p><span class="parno">29</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.33" href="#Kd.8.1.33"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, is the Lord purged?"<br>
<br>"I am purged, Jīvaka."<br>
<br>
"Now, Lord, it occurred to me after I had gone outside <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.396"></a>
the porch: ‘A purgative has been given by me to the Lord … thus the Lord will be purged all together thirty times.’ Lord, let the Lord bathe, let the well-farer bathe." Then the Lord bathed in the hot water; when he had bathed the Lord purged once; thus the Lord purged all together thirty times. Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, until the Lord’s body comes to be normal, almsfood of juices will be enough." And the Lord’s body soon became normal.</p>

<p><span class="parno">30</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.34" href="#Kd.8.1.34"></a>
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, taking that pair of Siveyyaka cloths, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, I ask one boon of the Lord."<br>
<br>"Jīvaka, Truth-finders are beyond (granting) boons."<br>
<br>"Lord, it is what is allowable and what is blameless."<br>
<br>"Speak on, Jīvaka."<br>
<br>
"Lord, the Lord and the Order of monks are wearers of rag-robes. Lord, this pair of Siveyyaka cloths was sent me by King Pajjota; of many cloths, of many pairs of cloths, of many hundred pairs of cloths, of many thousand pairs of cloths, of many hundred thousand pairs of cloths, it is the chief and best and foremost and most excellent and loveliest. Lord, may the Lord accept my pair of Siveyyaka cloths, and may he allow householders’ robes to the Order of monks." The Lord accepted the pair of Siveyyaka cloths. Then the Lord gladdened, rejoiced, roused, delighted Jīvaka Komārabhacca with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. And when Jīvaka Komārabhacca had been gladdened … delighted by the Lord with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, rising from his seat, greeting the Lord, he departed keeping his right side towards him.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.1.35" href="#Kd.8.1.35"></a>
Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>

"<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, householders’ robes. Whoever wishes may be a rag-robe wearer; whoever wishes may consent to (accept) householders’ robes. And I, monks, commend satisfaction with the one or the other.</span>"</p>

"Householders’ robes are allowed to monks by the Lord," and these people became joyful, elated, thinking: "Now we will give gifts, we will work merit, inasmuch as householders’ robes are allowed to monks by the Lord." And in just one day many thousand robes were produced in Rājagaha.</p>

Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca, taking that woollen stuff that was worth half a kāsi, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Jīvaka Komārabhacca spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, this woollen stuff that is worth half a <i lang="pi">kāsi</i>, being valued at half a <i lang="pi">kāsi</i>, was sent to me by the king of Kāsi.

Now at that time the monks who were accepters of robe-material, having accepted robe-material, leaving it just there, went away; the robe-material was lost. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.284"></a>

Now at that time the monks who were keepers of robe-material kept the robe-material in a shed and at the root of a tree and in the hollow of a nimb-tree; it was eaten by rats and white ants. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>
<br>"I allow you, monks, to agree upon a store-room that the Order desires: a dwelling-place or a curved house or a long house or a mansion or a cave.<br>

Now at that time the group of six monks turned away the guardian of a store-room. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="rule">Monks, a guardian of a store-room is not to be turned away. Whoever should turn him away, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span>"</p>

</p>

<p><span class="parno">63-65</span>Then the whole Order, distributing the robe-material, made a tumult. They told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>

 of robe-material: "Now, how should a share of the robe-material be given: in the order in which they came in, or according to seniority?" They told this matter to the Lord.

Now at that time monks
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.286"></a>
 dyed robe-material with dung and with yellow clay; the robe-material came to be a bad colour. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, six (kinds of) dyes: dye from roots, dye from stems, dye from bark, dye from leaves, dye from flowers, dye from fruits.</span>"<br>

Now at that time monks dyed robe-material with cold water; the robe-material came to smell nasty. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a little dye-pot in which to boil the dye.</span>" The dye was spilt. They told this matter to the Lord.

<p><span class="parno">76</span> Now at that time the monks did not have a dye-vessel. They told this matter to the Lord. He said "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a pitcher for the dye, a bowl for the dye.</span>"

<p><span class="parno">77</span> Now at that time monks steeped robe-material in a dish and also in a bowl, the robe-material was split. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a trough for the dye.</span>"<br>

Now at that time monks spread out robe-material on the ground; the robe-material became dusty. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a grass matting.</span>"
</p>

<p><span class="parno">79</span>The grass matting was eaten by white ants. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, a bamboo (for hanging up) robe-material, a cord for (hanging up) robe-material.</span>"

<p><span class="parno">80</span>They hung it up by the middle; the dye dripped down on both sides. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to fasten it at a corner.</span>"

<p><span class="parno">84</span>Now at that time robe-material became harsh. They told this matter to the Lord. He said: "<span class="allowance">I allow you, monks, to beat it with the hands.</span>"

Now at that time monks wore yellow robes, (the colour) of ivory, not cut up. People looked down, criticised, spread-it about, saying: "Like the householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses."

Then the Lord, having stayed in Rājagaha for as long as he found suitable, set out on tour for Dakkhiṇāgiri. The Lord saw the field of Magadha, laid
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.408"></a>
 out in strips, laid out in lines, laid out in embankments, laid out in squares, and seeing this, he addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:<br>
<br>"Now, do you Ānanda, see the field of Magadha laid out in strips … laid out in squares?"<br>
<br>"Yes, Lord."<br>
<br>"Are you able, Ānanda, to provide robes like this for the monks?"<br>
<br>"I am able, Lord."<br>
<br>Then the Lord, having stayed at Dakkhiṇāgiri for as long as he found suitable, went back again to Rājagaha. Then the venerable Ānanda, having provided robes for several monks, approached the Lord; having approached he spoke thus to the Lord:<br>
<br>"Lord, let the Lord see the robes provided by me."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.12.2" href="#Kd.8.12.2"></a>
Then the Lord, on that occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>

"Monks, clever is Ānanda; monks, of great intelligence is Ānanda, inasmuch as he can understand in detail the meaning of that which was spoken of by me in brief, and can make a cross-seam and can make a short cross-seam and can make a circular seam and can make a short circular seam and can

Then the Lord, having stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he found suitable, set out on tour for Vesālī. As the Lord was going along the high-road between Rājagaha and Vesālī he saw several monks coming along smothered up in robes, having put a mattress of robes on their heads and a mattress of robes on their backs and a mattress of robes on their hips,
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.410"></a>
 and seeing (them) it occurred to the Lord: "These foolish men are turned too quickly to abundance of robes;
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.288"></a>
 suppose I were to set a limit, were to establish bounds as to robes for the monks?"<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.13.2" href="#Kd.8.13.2"></a>
Then the Lord, walking on tour, in due course arrived at Vesālī. The Lord stayed there in Vesālī in the Gotamaka shrine. Now at that time on the cold winter nights between the "eights", in a time of snowfall, the Lord sat down in the open air at night with (only) one robe; the Lord was not cold. As the first watch of the night was ending the Lord became cold. The Lord put on a second robe; the Lord was not cold. As the middle watch of the night was ending the Lord became cold. The Lord put on a third robe; the Lord was not cold. As the last watch of the night was ending, as the sun was rising, in the flush of dawn, the Lord became cold. The Lord put on a fourth robe; the Lord was not cold.<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.13.3" href="#Kd.8.13.3"></a>
Then it occurred to the Lord: "Even those who in this <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> and discipline are sons of respectable families, susceptible to cold, afraid of cold, even these are able to keep themselves going with three robes. Suppose I were to set a limit, were to establish bounds as to robes for monks—were to allow three robes?"
</p>

<p><span class="parno">88</span>Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>

"Now as I, monks, was going along the high-road between Rājagaha and Vesālī, I saw several monks coming along smothered up in robes, having put a mattress of robes on

Now at that time the group of six monks, saying: "Three robes are allowed by the Lord," entered a village in one set of three robes, remained in the monastery in another set of three robes, went down to bathe in another set of three robes. Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can the group of six monks wear an extra robe?" Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>

 Ānanda; and the venerable Ānanda wanted to give this robe to the venerable Sāriputta, but the venerable Sāriputta was staying at Sāketa. Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda: "It is laid down by the Lord that an extra robe should not be worn. And this extra robe has accrued to me, and I want to give this robe to the venerable Sāriputta, but the venerable Sāriputta is staying at Sāketa. Now what line of conduct should be followed by me?" Then the venerable Ānanda told this matter to the Lord. He said:<br>
<br>"But how long, Ānanda, before Sāriputta will come (here)?"<br>
<br>"Lord, on the ninth or tenth day," he said.<br>
<br>Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>

Then the Lord, having stayed at Vesālī for as long as he found suitable, set out on tour for Benares. Walking on tour, in due course he arrived at Benares. The Lord stayed there near Benares in the deer-park at Isipatana. Now at that time a certain monk’s inner robe came to be torn. Then it occurred to that monk: "Three robes are allowed by the Lord: the double outer cloak, the single

 upper robe, the single inner robe. But my inner robe is torn. Suppose I were to insert a patch, so that it will be double cloth all round, single in the middle?"<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.14.2" href="#Kd.8.14.2"></a>
Then that monk inserted a patch. As the Lord was touring the lodgings he saw that monk inserting the patch; seeing

 (him) he approached that monk, having approached, he spoke thus to that monk:<br>

<br>"It is very good, monk, it is good that you, monk, insert a patch."</p>

<p><span class="parno">93</span>Then the Lord, on this occasion, having given reasoned talk, addressed the monks, saying:<br>

Then the Lord, having stayed at Benares for as long as he found suitable, set out on tour for Sāvatthī. Walking on tour, in due course he arrived at Sāvatthī. The Lord stayed there at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, she sat down at a respectful distance. As she was sitting down at a respectful distance, the Lord gladdened … delighted Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk. Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, when she had been gladdened … delighted by the Lord with <i lang="pi">dhamma</i>-talk, spoke thus to the Lord:<br>
<br>"Lord, may the Lord consent (to accept) from me a meal on the morrow together with the Order of monks."<br>
<br>
The Lord consented by becoming silent. Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, having understood the Lord’s consent, rising <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.414"></a>
from her seat, greeting the Lord, departed keeping her right side towards him.</p>

<p><span class="parno">95</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.15.2" href="#Kd.8.15.2"></a>
Then towards the end of that night a great cloud rained down in the four continents. Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying:<br>
<br>"Monks, even as it is raining in the Jeta Grove, so it is raining in the four continents. Let your bodies get wet with the rain, monks, this is the last great cloud over the four continents."<br>
<br>
"Very well, Lord," and these monks having answered the Lord <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.291"></a>
in assent, with their robes laid aside let their bodies get wet with the rain.</p>

<p><span class="parno">96</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.15.3" href="#Kd.8.15.3"></a>
Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, having had sumptuous food, solid and soft, prepared, commanded a woman-slave, saying:<br>
<br>"Go now, having gone to the monastery, announce the time, saying, ‘Lord, it is time, the meal is ready’."<br>
<br>"Very well, lady," and this slave-woman, having answered Visākhā, Migāra’s mother in assent, having gone to the monastery, saw the monks, their robes laid aside, letting their bodies get wet with the rain. Seeing them, she thought: "There are no monks in the monastery, naked ascetics are letting their bodies get wet with the rain." She approached Visākhā, Migāra’s mother; having approached, she spoke thus to Visākhā, Migāra’s mother:<br>
<br>"Lady, there are no monks in the monastery, naked ascetics are letting their bodies get wet with the rain.’’ Then it occurred to Visākhā, Migāra’s mother—she being clever, experienced, wise: "But undoubtedly it is the masters, their robes laid aside, who are letting their bodies get wet with the rain; this foolish woman thinks that there are no monks in the monastery, (but) that naked ascetics are letting their bodies get wet with the rain." She commanded the woman-slave, saying: "Go now, having gone to the monastery, announce the time, saying, ‘Lord, it is time, the meal is ready’."</p>

<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.415"></a>
Then these monks, having cooled their limbs, being refreshed in body, having taken up their robes, entered (each) his own dwelling-place. Then that woman-slave, having gone to the monastery, not seeing the monks, thinking: "There are no monks in the monastery, the monastery is empty," approached Visākhā, Migāra’s mother; having approached, she spoke thus to Visākhā, Migāra’s mother:<br>
<br>"Lady, there are no monks in the monastery, the monastery is empty." Then it occurred to Visākhā, Migāra’s mother—she being clever, experienced, wise: "But undoubtedly the masters, having cooled their limbs, being refreshed in body, having taken up their robes, have (each) entered his own dwelling-place; this foolish woman thinks that there are no monks in the monastery, that the monastery is empty."

<p><span class="parno">98</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.15.5" href="#Kd.8.15.5"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Monks, arrange your bowls and robes, it is time for the meal."<br>
<br>"Very well, Lord," these monks answered the Lord in assent.<br>
<br>Then the Lord, dressing in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, having vanished from the Jeta Grove, just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm, or might bend back his outstretched arm, became visible in the porch belonging to Visākhā, Migāra’s mother. Then the Lord sat down on an appointed seat together with the Order of monks.<br>

Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, saying: "Wonderful, good sirs, marvellous, good sirs, is the great psychic power, the great majesty of the Truth-finder, in that although the floods are rolling on knee-deep, and although the floods are rolling on waist-deep, yet neither the feet nor the robes of a single monk have become wet," and joyful, exultant, having with her own hand served and satisfied the Order of monks with the awakened one at their head with sumptuous solid and soft food, she sat down at a respectful distance after the Lord had eaten and had removed his hand from the bowl. As she was sitting down at a respectful distance, Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, spoke thus to the Lord:<br>

"I, Lord, want to give for life to the Order cloths for the rains, to give food for those coming in, to give food for those going out, to give food for the sick, to give food for those who tend the sick, to give medicine for the sick, to give a constant supply of conjey, to give bathing-cloths for the Order of nuns."<br>

"Now I, Lord, commanded a slave-woman, saying, ‘Go now, having gone to the monastery, announce the time, saying: Lord, it is time, the meal is ready’; but then, Lord, that slave-woman, having gone to the monastery, saw the monks, their robes laid aside, letting their bodies get wet with the rain; seeing them, she thought, ‘There are no monks in the monastery, naked ascetics are letting their bodies get wet with the rain’. She approached me, having approached, she spoke thus to me, ‘Lady, there are no monks in the monastery, naked ascetics are letting their bodies get wet with the rain’. <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.417"></a>

 I shall come to the conclusion that undoubtedly cloths for the rains or food for those coming in or food for those going out or food for the sick or food for those who tend the sick or medicines for the sick or a constant supply of conjey was enjoyed by this master. On my calling that to mind, delight will be born; from delight, joy will be born; because my mind is joyful my body will be calm; with the body calm I will experience ease; because I am at ease my mind will be contemplative; this will be for me growth as to the sense-organs, growth as to the powers, growth as to the factors of enlightenment.

"It is very good, Visākhā, it is good that you, Visākhā, having this advantage in mind, are asking the Truth-finder for the eight boons. I allow you, Visākhā, the eight boons." Then the Lord blessed Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, with these verses:</p>

 at Sāvatthī, went to a certain village-residence. People, saying: "It is long since the elders came (here)," gave food with robes. The resident monks asked the elders:<br>
<br>"Honoured sirs, thanks to the elders, these robes belonging to the Order, have accrued. Let the elders consent (to accept) a portion." The elders spoke thus:<br>
<br>
"In so far as we, your reverences, understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> as taught by the Lord, these robes are for you yourselves until the removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges)."</p>

Now at that time three monks were spending the rains in Rājagaha. People there, saying: "We are giving for an Order," gave robes. Then it occurred to these monks:
<a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.300"></a>
 "It is laid down by the Lord that the least Order is fourfold, but we are three persons, and these people, saying, ‘We are giving for an Order’, gave robes. Now what line of conduct should be followed by us?" Now at that time several elders, the venerable Nilavāsin and the venerable Sāṇavāsin and the venerable Gopaka and the venerable Bhagu and the venerable Phalikasandāna, were staying at Pāṭaliputta in the Cock’s monastery. Then these monks, having gone to Pāṭaliputta, asked the elders. The elders spoke thus: "In so far as we understand <i lang="pi">dhamma</i> as taught by the Lord, it is that these robes are for you yourselves until the removal of the <i lang="pi">kaṭhina</i> (privileges)."</p>

Now at that time the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having spent the rains at Sāvatthī, went to a certain village-residence. And there the monks assembled, wishing to
<a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.429"></a>
 distribute robe-material. These spoke thus: "These robes, your reverence, belonging to the Order, will be distributed. Will you consent (to accept) a portion?"<br>
<br>"Yes, your reverences, I will consent," and taking up a portion of the robe-material from there, he went to another residence. The monks there also assembled, wishing to distribute robe-material. These also spoke thus: "These robes, your reverence, belonging to the Order, will be distributed. Will you consent (to accept) a portion?"<br>
<br>"Yes, your reverences, I will consent," and taking up a portion of the robe-material from there too, he went to another residence.

<br>
"Whence, your reverences, is there merit for me? Now I, your reverences, having spent the rains at Sāvatthī, went to a certain village-residence.

"But is it that you, reverend Upananda, having spent the rains somewhere else, will consent (to accept) a portion of robe-material elsewhere?"<br>
<br>"Yes, your reverences," he said.

<p><span class="parno">141</span>Those who were modest monks looked down upon, criticised, spread it about, saying: "How can the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, having spent the rains somewhere else, consent (to accept) robe-material elsewhere?"

Now at that time the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans, spent the rains alone in two residences, thinking: "Thus will much robe-material accrue to me." Then it occurred to these monks: "Now, how should a share of robe-material be given to the venerable Upananda, the son of the Sakyans?" They told this matter to the Lord. He said: <br>
<br>
"Monks, give one share to the foolish man. For this is a case, monks, where a monk is spending the rains alone in two residences, thinking, ‘Thus will much robe-material accrue me’. If he stays half (the time) at one, half (the time) at the <a class="pts_pn" id="BD.4.431"></a>

Now at that time a certain monk was suffering from dysentery; he lay fallen in his own excrements. Then the Lord, as he was touring the lodgings with the venerable Ānanda as his attendant, approached that monk’s dwelling-place. The Lord saw that monk lying fallen in his own excrements; seeing him he approached that monk, and having approached he spoke thus to that monk:<br>
<br>"What is your disease, monk?" <br>
<br>"Lord, I have dysentery."<br>
<br>"But, monk, have you anyone who tends you?" <br>
<br>
"I have not, Lord," <a class="pts_pn" id="Vin.1.302"></a>
he said.<br>
<br>"Why do not the monks tend you?" <br>
<br>"I, Lord, am of no use to the monks, therefore the monks do not tend me."<br>
<br><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.26.2" href="#Kd.8.26.2"></a>
Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying: "Go, Ānanda, bring water, we will bathe this monk."<br>
<br>"Very well, Lord," and the venerable Ānanda, having answered the Lord in assent, when he had brought the water, the Lord sprinkled on the water, the venerable Ānanda washed him over; the Lord took him by the head, the venerable Ānanda by the feet, and having raised him up, they laid him down on a couch.</p>

<p><span class="parno">144</span><a class="pts_pn" id="Kd.8.26.3" href="#Kd.8.26.3"></a>
Then the Lord, on that occasion, in that connection, having had the Order of monks convened, asked the monks:<br>
<br>"Is there, monks, in such and such a dwelling-place a monk who is ill?"<br>
<br>"There is, Lord."<br>
