Snp 3.12. DVAYATĀNUPASSANĀ SUTTA - CONTEMPLATION OF DYADS (Excerpt)
15. Truth and Deception
“If, bhikkhus, they ask you, ‘Might there be another way of rightly observing duality?’ you should say, ‘There is’. And how is there?

“‘That which is regarded as truth by this world together with its gods, its Māras and its Brahmās, in this generation together with its ascetics and priests, its princes and people, that the noble ones, having clearly seen with correct wisdom in accordance with reality, understand to be false’, this is one observation. ‘That which is regarded as false by this world together with its gods, its Māras and its Brahmās, in this generation together with its ascetics and priests, its princes and people, that the noble ones, having clearly seen with correct wisdom in accordance with reality, understand to be true’, this is a second observation. Rightly observing this duality, a monk who meditates diligent, ardent, and resolute may expect one of two results: final knowledge in this very life, or is there is anything left over, non-return."

This is what the Buddha said. Having said this, the Teacher, the Sublime One, said further:

762 Look at this world with its gods,
Enmeshed in the physical and the mental,
Thinking not-self is self,
It thinks, “This is truth".

763 Whatever they think it is,
It becomes something else;
That is false for them,
For transient things are delusory.

764 But quenching is not delusory,
That the noble ones know to be true;
By comprehending the truths,
They are wishless, quenched.

16. Happiness and Suffering
“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’ you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’ And how could there be? ‘In this world, bhikkhus, with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, that which is regarded as “This is happiness,” the noble ones have seen well with correct wisdom thus: “This is suffering” ’ — this is one contemplation. ‘In this world, bhikkhus, with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, that which is regarded as “This is suffering,” the noble ones have seen well with correct wisdom thus, “This is happiness” ’ — this is a second contemplation. When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad — heedful, ardent, and resolute — one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life, or, if there is a residue of clinging, the state of non-returning.”
This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:
	759. “Forms, sounds, tastes, odors,
	textures, and objects of mind —
	all are desirable, lovely, agreeable,
	so long as it is said: ‘They are.’
	760. “These are considered as happiness
	in the world with its devas;
	but where these cease,
	that they consider suffering.
	761. “The noble ones have seen as happiness
	the ceasing of the personal entity.
	Running counter to the entire world
	is this [insight] of those who see.
	762. “What others speak of as happiness,
	that the noble ones speak of as suffering.
	What others speak of as suffering,
	that the noble ones have known as happiness.
	Behold this Dhamma hard to comprehend:
	here the foolish are bewildered.
	763. “There is gloom for those who are blocked,
	darkness for those who do not see,
	but for the good it is opened up
	like light for those who see.
	The brutes unskilled in the Dhamma
	do not understand it even when close.
	764. “This Dhamma is not easily understood
	by those afflicted by lust for existence,
	by those flowing in the stream of existence,
	deeply mired in Māra’s realm.
	765. “Who else apart from the noble ones
	are able to understand this state?
	When they have correctly known that state,
	those without āsavā attain nibbāna.”
This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One’s statement. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of sixty bhikkhus were liberated from the āsavā by non-clinging.
